MAGIC INFRACTION PROCEDURE GUIDE
<p class="calibre1">
Effective March 27, 2015
</p><p class="calibre1">
INTRODUCTION
</p><p class="calibre1">
The Magic- Infraction Procedure Guide provides judges the appropriate penalties and procedures to handle rules violations that occur during a tournament held at Competitive or Professional Rules Enforcement Level (REL), as well as the underlying philosophy that guides their implementation. It exists to protect players from potential misconduct and to protect the integrity of the tournament itself. Rules violations usually require a penalty or they are unenforceable. Tournaments run at Regular REL use the Judging at Regular REL document.
</p><p class="calibre1">
FRAMEWORK OF THIS DOCUMENT
</p><p class="calibre1">
This document is divided into two major parts: General Definitions and Philosophy (section 1), and Infractions (sections 2-4).
</p><p class="calibre1">
Infractions are broken down into general classes (Game Play Error, Tournament Error, and Unsporting Conduct), and further into subclasses for specific infractions.
</p><p class="calibre1">

GENERAL PHILOSOPHY
<p class="calibre1">
Judges are neutral arbiters and enforcers of policy and rules. A judge shouldn't intervene in a game unless he or she believes a rules violation has occurred, a player with a concern or question requests assistance, or the judge wishes to prevent a situation from escalating. Judges don't stop play errors from occurring, but instead deal with errors that have occurred, penalize those who violate rules or policy, and promote fair play and sporting conduct by example and diplomacy. Judges may intervene to prevent or preempt errors occurring outside of a game.
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
All players are treated equally according to the guidelines of an event's Rules Enforcement Level (REL).
</p><p class="calibre1">
Knowledge of a player's history does not influence the recognition of an infraction or the application of penalties, though it may affect the manner of an investigation. The REL of an event defines what is expected from a player regarding his or her rules and policy knowledge and technical play skill.
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
Treating a player differently because he or she once played in a Professional event would mean holding each player to a different standard and would produce inconsistent rulings that depended on the judge's familiarity with the player. Professionals should be able to play in events without being held to a higher technical level of play against less-experienced opponents who may not be as familiar with the rules.
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
The purpose of a penalty is to educate the player not to make similar mistakes in the future. This is done through both an explanation of where the rules or policies were violated and a penalty to reinforce the education. Penalties are also for the deterrence and education of every other player in the event and are also used to track player behavior over time.
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
The level of penalty an infraction carries is based on these factors:
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
- The potential for abuse (or risk of being exposed).
</p><p class="calibre1">
- Repeated offenses by the player within the tournament.
</p><p class="calibre1">
- The amount of disruption it causes (time and people affected) in discovering, investigating, and resolving the issue.
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
Only the Head Judge is authorized to issue penalties that deviate from these guidelines. The Head Judge may not deviate from this guide's procedures except in significant and exceptional circumstances or a situation that has no applicable philosophy for guidance. Significant and exceptional circumstances are rare-a table collapses, a booster contains cards from a different set, etc. The Rules Enforcement Level, round of the tournament, age or experience-level of the player, desire to educate the player, and certification level of the judge are NOT exceptional circumstances. If another judge feels deviation is appropriate, he or she must consult with the Head Judge.
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
Judges should be seen as a benefit to the players, helping to ensure the consistent and fair running of a tournament.
</p><p class="calibre1">
Players should be encouraged to use judges as needed, and should not be afraid to call a judge when one is required.
</p><p class="calibre1">
If a player commits an offense, realizes it, and calls a judge over immediately and before he or she could potentially benefit from the offense, the Head Judge has the option to downgrade the penalty without it being considered a deviation, though he or she should still follow any procedures recommended to fix the error. For example, a player offers his deck to his opponent and while cutting his opponent's deck discovers that a card that belongs in his deck is still exiled from a previous game. If he calls the judge over immediately, the Head Judge may choose to issue a Warning rather than a Game Loss.
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
Judges are human and make mistakes. When a judge makes a mistake, he or she should acknowledge the mistake, apologize to the players, and fix it if it is not too late. If the judge gives a player erroneous information that causes them to commit a violation, the Head Judge is authorized to downgrade the penalty. For example, a player asks a judge whether a card is legal for a format and is told yes. When that player's deck is found to be illegal because of these cards, the Head Judge applies the normal procedure for fixing the decklist, but may downgrade the penalty to a Warning because of the direct error of the judge.

</p><p class="calibre1">
<a id="1.1"></a></p><h4 class="calibre3">1.1 DEFINITION OF RULES ENFORCEMENT LEVEL (REL)</h4>
<p class="calibre1">
Rules Enforcement Level is a means to communicate to the players and judges what expectations they can have of the event in terms of rigidity of rules enforcement, technically correct play, and procedures used.
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
The REL of an event will increase based on the prizes awarded and the distance a player may be expected to travel.
</p><p class="calibre1">
People who travel further are often more competitive and are likely to desire more precise adherence to rules and procedures. The REL of the event reflects this.
</p><p class="calibre1">
Regular
</p><p class="calibre1">
Regular events are focused on fun and social aspects, not enforcement. Most tournaments are run at this level unless they offer sizeable prizes or invitations. Players are expected to know most of the game rules, may have heard of policy and what is really bad, but generally play in a fashion similar to the way he or she does at home. Players are still responsible for following the rules, but the focus is on education and sportsmanship over technically precise play. Handling infractions in these tournaments is covered by the Judging at Regular REL document.
</p><p class="calibre1">
Competitive
</p><p class="calibre1">
Competitive events are usually those with significant cash prizes or invitations awarded to Professional events.
</p><p class="calibre1">
Players are expected to know the game's rules-but not to a technically detailed level-and be familiar with the policies and procedures, but unintentional errors are not punished severely. These are events that protect the interests of all players by providing event integrity while also recognizing that not all players are intimately familiar with Professional-level event structure, proper procedures, and rules.
</p><p class="calibre1">
Professional
</p><p class="calibre1">
Professional level events offer large cash awards, prestige, and other benefits that draw players from great distances.
</p><p class="calibre1">
These events hold players to a higher standard of behavior and technically correct play than Competitive events.
</p><p class="calibre1">
<a id="1.2"></a></p><h4 class="calibre3">1.2 DEFINITION OF PENALTIES</h4>
<p class="calibre1">
Caution
</p><p class="calibre1">
A Caution is a verbal admonition to a player. Cautions are used in situations of minor incorrect play or disruption where a quick word can easily correct the behavior or situation. No extra time is required for a Caution, as any Caution that takes more than a few moments to resolve should be upgraded to a Warning.
</p><p class="calibre1">
Warning
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
A Warning is an officially tracked penalty. Warnings are used in situations of incorrect play when a small amount of time is needed to implement the corrective procedure. The purpose of a Warning is to alert judges and players involved that a problem has occurred and to keep a permanent record of the infraction in the DCI Penalty Database.
</p><p class="calibre1">
A time extension should be issued if the ruling has taken more than a minute.
</p><p class="calibre1">
Game Loss
</p><p class="calibre1">
A Game Loss is issued in situations where the procedure to correct the offense takes a significant amount of time that may slow the entire tournament or causes significant disruption to the tournament, or in which it is impossible to continue the game due to physical disruption. It is also used for some infractions that have a higher probability for a player to gain advantage.
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
A Game Loss ends the current game immediately and the player who committed the infraction is considered to have lost the game for the purpose of match reporting. The player receiving a Game Loss chooses whether to play or draw in the next game of that match, if applicable. If a Game Loss is issued before the match begins, neither player in that match may use sideboards (if the tournament uses them) for the first game they play.
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
Game Losses are applied to the game in which the offense occurred unless the players have begun a new game or the tournament is between rounds, in which case the loss is applied to the player's next game. If simultaneous Game Loss penalties are issued to each player, they are recorded, but do not affect the match score. If a player receives a Game Loss at the same time his or her opponent receives a Match Loss, the Game Loss is carried over into the next 4
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
round. Players will still receive a Game Loss if they drop from the tournament; if the penalty is issued between rounds, they will still receive it even though they will not be paired for the next round.
</p><p class="calibre1">
Match Loss
</p><p class="calibre1">
A Match Loss is a severe penalty that is usually issued when the match cannot be completed due to timing restrictions or because the match itself has been compromised.
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
Match Losses are applied to the match during which the offense occurred unless the match has already ended, in which case the penalty will be applied to the player's next match. Players will still be issued a Match Loss penalty if they drop from the tournament, though they won't be paired for the next round.
</p><p class="calibre1">
Disqualification
</p><p class="calibre1">
A Disqualification is issued for activity that damages the integrity of a tournament as a whole or for severe unsporting conduct.
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
The recipient of a Disqualification does not need to be a player in the tournament. He or she may be a spectator or other bystander. If this happens, he or she must be entered into the tournament in Wizards Event Reporter (WER) so that he or she may be disqualified and reported to the DCI.
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
Disqualification can occur without proof of action so long as the Head Judge determines sufficient information exists to believe the tournament's integrity may have been compromised. It is recommended that the Head Judge's report reflect this fact.
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
When this penalty is applied, the player loses his or her current match and is dropped from the tournament. If a player has already received prizes at the time he or she is disqualified, that player may keep those prizes but does not receive any additional prizes or awards he or she may be due.
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
When a player is disqualified during a tournament, he or she is removed from the tournament and does not take up a place in the standings. This means that all players in the tournament will advance one spot in the standings and are entitled to any prizes the new standing would offer. If the Disqualification takes place after a cut is made, no additional players advance in place of the disqualified player although they do move up a spot in the standings. For example, if a player is disqualified during the quarterfinal round of a Pro Tour Qualifier, the former 9th place finisher does not advance into the single elimination top 8, but he or she does move into 8th place in the standings.
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">

</p><p class="calibre1">
<a id="1.3"></a></p><h4 class="calibre3">1.3 APPLYING PENALTIES</h4>
<p class="calibre1">
Any penalty higher than a Caution is included with the tournament report so that a permanent record can be kept in the DCI Penalty Database. Additionally, any penalty of Game Loss or higher should be reported to the Head Judge, and it is recommended that only the Head Judge issue penalties of this nature (with the exception of Tardiness (3.1) and Deck Errors (3.5)).
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
Any time a penalty is issued, the judge must explain the infraction, the procedure for fixing the situation, and the penalty to all players involved. If the Head Judge chooses to deviate from the Infraction Procedure Guide, the Head Judge is expected to explain the standard penalty and the reason for deviation.
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
Some infractions include remedies to handle the offense beyond the base penalty. These procedures exist to protect officials from accusations of unfairness, bias, or favoritism. If a judge makes a ruling that is consistent with quoted text, then the complaints of a player shift from accusation of unfairness by the judge to accusations of unfair policy.
</p><p class="calibre1">
Deviations from these procedures may raise accusations against the judge from the player(s) involved, or from those who hear about it.
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
These procedures do not, and should not, take into account the game being played, the current situation that the game is in, or who will benefit strategically from the procedure associated with a penalty. While it is tempting to try to fix game situations, the danger of missing a subtle detail or showing favoritism to a player (even unintentionally) makes it a bad idea.
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
Separate infractions committed or discovered at the same time are treated as separate penalties, though if the root cause is the same, only the more severe one is applied. If the first penalty would cause the second one issued to the same player to be inapplicable for the round (such as a Game Loss issued along with a Match Loss), the more severe penalty is issued first, followed by the less severe penalty in the next round.
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
Some violations of tournament rules will not meet the criteria for any specific infraction. Many minor offenses that a player can commit, even intentionally, are not covered by a specific infraction and can be handled initially with a Caution. If these behaviors continue, the judge may instruct them to stop and treat further incidents as Unsporting Conduct  Minor.
</p><p class="calibre1">
<a id="1.4"></a></p><h4 class="calibre3">1.4 BACKING UP</h4>
<p class="calibre1">
Some infractions in this document permit the judge to consider the possibility of a backup. Due to the amount of information that may become available to players and might affect their play, backups are regarded as a solution of last resort, only applied in situations where leaving the game in the current state is a substantially worse solution. A good backup will result in a situation where the gained information makes no difference and the line of play remains the same (excepting the error, which has been fixed). This means limiting backups to situations with minimal decision trees.
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
Only the Head Judge may authorize a backup. At large tournaments, they may choose to delegate this responsibility to Team Leaders.
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
To perform a backup, each individual action since the point of the error is reversed, starting with the most recent ones and working backwards. Every action must be reversed; no parts of the sequence should be omitted or reordered. If the identity of a card involved in reversing an action is unknown to one of the players (usually because it was drawn), a random card is chosen from the possible candidates. A shuffle is reversed by shuffling again.
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
Backups involving random/unknown elements should be approached with extreme caution, especially if they cause or threaten to cause a situation in which a player will end up with different cards than they would once they have correctly drawn those cards. For example, returning cards to the library when a player has the ability to shuffle their library is not something that should be done except in extreme situations.
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
<a id="2"></a></p><h4 class="calibre3">2 GAME PLAY ERRORS</h4>
<p class="calibre1">
Game Play Errors are caused by incorrect or inaccurate play of the game such that it results in violations of the Magic Comprehensive Rules. Many offenses fit into this category and it would be impossible to list them all. The guide below is designed to give judges a framework for assessing how to handle a Game Play Error.
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
Most Game Play Error infractions are assumed to have been committed unintentionally. If the judge believes that the error was intentional, he or she should first consider whether an Unsporting Conduct - Cheating infraction has occurred.
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
Both players are expected to maintain the game rules and to share some responsibility for any errors that may occur involving public information. As a result, no attempt should be made to determine or correct any advantage gained in assessing the penalty and associated procedures for fixing the offense. Additionally, for most Game Play Errors not caught within a time that a player could reasonably be expected to notice, teammates and opponents receive a Game Play Error - Failure to Maintain Game State penalty. In multiplayer games, all participants in the match other than the offending player receive this penalty if they meet the criteria.
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
A third or subsequent penalty for a Game Play Error offense in the same category is upgraded to a Game Loss. For multi-day events, the penalty count for these infractions resets between days.
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
If the players are playing in a way that is clear to both players, but might cause confusion to an external observer, judges are encouraged to request that the players make the situation clear, but not issue any penalty.

<p class="calibre1">
A triggered ability triggers, but the player controlling the ability doesn't demonstrate awareness of the trigger's existence the first time that it would affect the game in a visible fashion.
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
The point by which the player needs to demonstrate this awareness depends on the impact that the trigger would have on the game:
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
- A triggered ability that requires its controller to choose targets (other than 'target opponent'), modes, or other choices made when the ability is put onto the stack: The controller must announce those choices before they next pass priority.
</p><p class="calibre1">
- A triggered ability that causes a change in the visible game state (including life totals) or requires a choice upon resolution: The controller must take the appropriate physical action or make it clear what the action taken or choice made is before taking any game actions (such as casting a sorcery spell or explicitly moving to the next step or phase) that can be taken only after the triggered ability should have resolved.
</p><p class="calibre1">
Note that casting an instant spell or activating an ability doesn't mean a triggered ability has been forgotten, as it could still be on the stack.
</p><p class="calibre1">
- A triggered ability that changes the rules of the game: The controller must acknowledge the trigger or prevent an opponent from taking any resulting illegal action.
</p><p class="calibre1">
- A triggered ability that affects the game state in non-visible ways: The controller must take physical action or make it clear what the action is by the first time the change has an effect on the visible game state.
</p><p class="calibre1">

Triggered abilities that do nothing except create one or more copies of a spell or ability (such as storm or cipher) automatically resolve, but awareness of the resulting objects must be demonstrated using the same requirements as described above (even though the objects may not be triggered abilities).

Players may not cause triggered abilities controlled by an opponent to be missed by taking game actions or otherwise prematurely advancing the game. For example, if a player draws a card during his or her draw step without allowing an opponent to demonstrate awareness of a triggered ability, the controller still has an opportunity to fulfill the appropriate obligation by doing so at that point. The Out-of-Order Sequencing rules (MTR section 4.3) may also be applicable, especially as they relate to batches of actions or resolving items on the stack in an improper order.

If a triggered ability would have no impact on the game, it's not an infraction to fail to demonstrate awareness of it.
</p><p class="calibre1">
For example, if the effect of a triggered ability instructs its controller to sacrifice a creature, a player who controls no creatures isn't required to demonstrate awareness of the ability.
</p><p class="calibre1">

<p class="calibre1">
A. Knight of Infamy (a 2/1 creature with exalted) attacks alone. Its controller says Take two.<br class="calibre10"/>

</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><h4 class="calibre3"><b class="calibre9">Philosophy</b></h4>
<p class="calibre1">
Triggered abilities are common and invisible, so players should not be harshly penalized when forgetting about one.
</p><p class="calibre1">
Players are expected to remember their own triggered abilities; intentionally ignoring one may be Unsporting Conduct - Cheating (unless the ability would have no impact on the game as described above). Even if an opponent is involved in the announcement or resolution of the ability, the controller is still responsible for ensuring the opponents make the appropriate choices and take the appropriate actions. Opponents are not required to point out triggered abilities that they do not control, though they may do so if they wish.
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
Triggered abilities are assumed to be remembered until otherwise indicated, and the impact on the game state may not be immediately apparent. The opponent's benefit is in not having to point out triggered abilities, although this does not mean that they can cause triggers to be missed. If an opponent requires information about the precise timing of a triggered ability or needs details about a game object that may be affected by a resolved triggered ability, that player may need to acknowledge that ability's existence before its controller does.
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
The controller of a missed triggered ability receives a Warning only if the triggered ability is usually considered detrimental for the controlling player. The current game state is not a factor in determining this, though symmetrical abilities (such as Howling Mine) may be considered usually detrimental or not depending on who is being affected.
</p><p class="calibre1">
Whether a Warning is issued or not does not affect any additional remedies that may be applicable. Failure to Maintain Game State penalties are never issued to players who did not control the ability.
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
Judges do not intervene in a missed trigger situation unless they intend to issue a Warning or have reason to suspect that the controller is intentionally missing his or her triggered abilities.
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><h4 class="calibre3"><b class="calibre9">Additional Remedy</b></h4>
<p class="calibre1">
If the triggered ability specifies a default action associated with a choice made by the controller (usually "If you don't ..." or "... unless"), resolve it choosing the default option. If the triggered ability is a delayed triggered ability that changes the zone of an object, resolve it. For these two types of abilities, the opponent chooses whether to resolve the ability the next time a player would get priority or when a player would get priority at the start of the next phase. These abilities do not expire and should be remedied no matter how much time has passed since they should have triggered.
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
If the triggered ability creates an effect whose duration has already expired or the ability was missed prior to the current phase in the previous player's turn, instruct the players to continue playing.
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
If the triggered ability isn't covered by the previous two paragraphs, the opponent chooses whether the triggered ability is added to the stack. If it is, it's inserted at the appropriate place on the stack if possible or on the bottom of the stack. No player may make choices involving objects that were not in the appropriate zone or zones when the 8
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
ability should have triggered. For example, if the ability instructs a player to sacrifice a creature, that player can't sacrifice a creature that wasn't on the battlefield when the ability should have triggered.

<p class="calibre1">
Shuffle the randomized portion of the deck (which may include the cards that were seen, if they were part of the random portion of the library). This requires first determining whether any portion of the deck is non-random, such as cards that have been manipulated on the top or bottom of the library, and separating those. Once the deck has been shuffled, any manipulated cards are returned to their correct locations.
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">

Care must be taken before shuffling to make sure that there are no legally known cards in the library. Check with both players to verify this, and check the graveyard, exile, and battlefield for deck manipulation cards, such as Brainstorm and cards with the scry mechanic.

- If a player forgot to draw cards, discard cards, or return cards from their hand to another zone, that player does so.
</p><p class="calibre1">
- If an object changing zones is put into the wrong zone, the identity of the object was known to all players, and it can be moved without disrupting the state of the game, put the object in the correct zone.

- If attacker or blocker order has not been declared, the appropriate player orders them.

<p class="calibre1">
Players are expected to shuffle their deck thoroughly when it is required and are expected to have the skill and understanding of randomization to do so.

Any time cards in a deck could be seen, including during shuffling, it is no longer shuffled, even if the player only knows the position of one or two cards. Players are expected to take care in shuffling not to reveal cards to themselves, their teammates, or their opponents.

<p class="calibre1">
Decklists are used to ensure that decks are not altered in the course of a tournament. Judges and other tournament officials should be vigilant about reminding players before the tournament begins of the importance of submitting a legal decklist, and playing with a legal deck.
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
Penalties for decklist errors discovered after the affected player has begun playing his or her match are issued at the start of the next round to minimize the disruption to the match currently being played and provide consistency in case some players have finished playing their match before the penalty can be administered.
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">

Ambiguous or unclear names on a decklist may allow a player to manipulate the contents of his or her deck up until the point at which they are discovered. The Head Judge may choose to not issue this penalty if they believe that 14

</p><p class="calibre1">
what the player wrote on their decklist is obvious and unambiguous, even if it is not the full, accurate name of the card. This should be determined solely by what is written on the decklist, and not based on intent or the actual contents of the deck; needing to check the deck for confirmation is a sign that the entry is not obvious.
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
If the sideboard is not kept sufficiently separate from the deck during play, it becomes impossible to determine the legality of the deck. Additionally, if there are extra cards stored with the sideboard that could conceivably be played in the player's deck, they will be considered a part of the sideboard unless they are:
</p><p class="calibre1">

</p><p class="calibre1">
- Promotional cards that have been handed out as part of the tournament.
</p><p class="calibre1">

- Double-faced cards being used to represent the night' side of cards in the deck.
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">

These cards must not be sleeved in the same way as cards in the main deck and/or sideboard.
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><h4 class="calibre3"><b class="calibre9">Additional Remedy</b></h4>
<p class="calibre1">
Remove any cards from the deck that are illegal for the format or violate the maximum number allowed, fix any failures to de-sideboard, restore any missing cards if they (or identical replacements) can be located, then alter the decklist to reflect the remaining deck. If the remaining deck has too few cards, add basic lands of the player's choice to reach the minimum number. If the deck and decklist both violate a maximum cards restriction (usually too many cards in a sideboard or more than four of a card), remove cards starting from the bottom of the appropriate section of the list.
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
If a player, before taking any game actions, discovers a deck problem and calls a judge at that point, the Head Judge may downgrade the penalty, fix the deck, and allow the player to redraw the hand with one fewer card. The player may continue to take further mulligans if he or she desires.

A player's cards are marked or oriented in a way that could potentially give an advantage to that player.

</p><h4 class="calibre3"><b class="calibre9">Examples</b></h4>
<p class="calibre1">
A. A player has small marks on a few of his sleeves. The markings are on a Mountain, a Loxodon Hierarch, and a Lightning Helix.<br class="calibre10"/>

<p class="calibre1">
Sleeves and cards often become worn over the course of a tournament, and, as long as the player is not attempting to take advantage of this, addressing the situation is sufficient in most cases. Note that almost all sleeves can be considered marked in some way; judges should keep this in mind when determining penalties. In cases of marked cards, educating players to shuffle their cards and sleeves before sleeving the cards is very important.
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><h4 class="calibre3"><b class="calibre9">Additional Remedy</b></h4>
<p class="calibre1">
The player needs to replace the card(s) or sleeve(s) with an unmarked version or, if no sleeves are being used, use sleeves that conceal the markings. If the cards themselves have become marked through play in the tournament, the Head Judge may decide to issue a proxy. If the player is unable to find replacement cards, he or she may replace those cards with basic lands for the remainder of the tournament. If he or she chooses to do so, the decklist is changed and cannot be reverted, even if replacements are found.
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
The Head Judge has the option to upgrade this penalty to a Game Loss if he or she believes that a player noticing the pattern of markings would clearly compromise the integrity of the game.

Unsporting behavior is not the same as a lack of sporting behavior. There is a wide middle ground of competitive

Judges should inform the player how his or her conduct is disruptive. The player is expected to correct the situation and behavior immediately.

</p><h4 class="calibre3"><b class="calibre9">Definition</b></h4>
<p class="calibre1">
A person breaks a rule defined by the tournament documents, lies to a tournament official, or notices an offense committed in his or her (or a teammate's) match and does not call attention to it.
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
Additionally, the offense must meet the following criteria for it to be considered Cheating:

</p><p class="calibre1">
- The player must be attempting to gain advantage from his or her action.
</p><p class="calibre1">
- The player must be aware that he or she is doing something illegal.

</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre1">
If all criteria are not met, the offense is not Cheating and is handled by a different infraction. Cheating will often appear on the surface as a Game Play Error or Tournament Error, and must be investigated by the judge to make a determination of intent and awareness.
</p><p class="calibre1">

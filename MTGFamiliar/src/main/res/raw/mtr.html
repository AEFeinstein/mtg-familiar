<br>The DCI is a worldwide organization dedicated to organized play. It 
promotes, enforces, and develops rules and policies using the goals and 
philosophies defined in this document and the <b>Magic: The Gathering</b> Infraction Procedure Guide. It constantly reviews these rules and policies to ensure its goals are met. 
<br>The purpose of this document is to provide the infrastructure used to run <b>Magic: The Gathering</b> (“<b>Magic</b>”) tournaments by defining appropriate rules, responsibilities, and procedures to be followed in all DCI-sanctioned <b>Magic</b>
 tournaments. DCI-sanctioned tournaments are to be run consistently 
regardless of their location. This ensures equal treatment of players in
 different regions and also enables their smooth transition to 
international tournaments. 
<br>All players are treated equally and share responsibilities according
 to the Rules Enforcement Level (REL) of the tournament. For more 
information about Rules Enforcement Levels, see the <b>Magic</b> Infraction Procedure Guide at <a
                        href="http://www.wizards.com/wpn/Events/Rules.aspx">http://www.wizards.com/wpn/Events/Rules.aspx</a>.
 Both players and officials should cooperate to achieve their common 
goal of running a proper DCI-sanctioned tournament. Players and 
officials must treat each other in a fair and respectful manner, 
following both the rules and the spirit in which those rules were 
created. They are responsible for following the most current version of 
the <b>Magic</b> Tournament Rules and any other applicable regulatory 
documents, including the Comprehensive Rules and the Infraction 
Procedure Guide. Spectators have their own set of responsibilities. 
Individuals violating DCI rules are subject to the appropriate 
provisions of the Infraction Procedure Guide. 
<br>Information in this document may contradict (or have information not contained in) the <b>Magic: The Gathering</b> Comprehensive Rules. In such cases, this document takes precedence. 
<br>Tournament fact sheets for specific tournaments may define 
alternative or additional policies or procedures. If a contradiction 
exists between this document and a fact sheet, the information in the 
fact sheet takes precedence.
<br>Wizards of the Coast reserves the right to alter these rules, as 
well as the right to interpret, modify, clarify, or otherwise issue 
official changes to these rules without prior notice. 
<br>Future updates to this document are scheduled to be announced on the
 Monday immediately following the Prerelease weekend of an expansion or 
core set. Each update will become effective on the release date of that 
expansion or core set.

Premier tournaments are run by Wizards of the Coast or select Tournament

<br>There are two major tournament formats – Limited and Constructed. 
Each has rules specific to its format. In Limited tournaments, all 
product for play is provided during the tournament. In Constructed 
tournaments, players compete using decks prepared beforehand. Some

<br>If one or more tournament officials play in the tournament, it must 
be run at Regular REL. If tournament officials play in the tournament 
and the tournament is not one of the allowed event types listed above, 
the tournament will be invalidated. Tournament officials are required to
 officiate tournaments fairly and without regard to their own 
self-interest.
<br>
<br>The owners of organizations that run Premier Events are not 
permitted to play in those events (even if the owner is not listed as a 
tournament official (organizer, judge, and/or scorekeeper) for that 
event. 
<br>
<br>Premier Events include the following events: <b>Magic: The Gathering</b> Players Championship, World <b>Magic</b> Cup, World <b>Magic</b> Cup Qualifiers, Pro Tour, Pro Tour Qualifier, Grand Prix, Grand Prix Trial, WPN Premium Tournament, and WPN Premium Qualifier.
<br>
<br>Some tournaments have additional criteria regarding player and 
tournament official eligibility (e.g. invitation-only tournaments, such 
as Pro Tour events).
<br> 
<br>The Premier Event Invitation Policy defines specific eligibility 
rules with regards to certain types of invitation-only Premier 
Tournaments (e.g. Pro Tours).
<br>
<br>Individuals with questions regarding their tournament eligibility 
should contact the DCI policy manager (Scott.Larabee@wizards.com). </span></span>

 tournaments require the physical presence of a Head Judge during play 
to adjudicate disputes, interpret rules, and make other official 
decisions. The Head Judge is the final judicial authority at any 
DCI-sanctioned tournament and all tournament participants are expected 
to follow his or her interpretations. Although it is beneficial, the 
Head Judge does not have to be DCI-certified.
<br>
<br>The Head Judge’s responsibilities include:
<br><ul>
                        <br>
                        <li>Ensuring that all necessary steps are taken to deal with game or

                        <br>
                        <li>Issuing the final ruling in all appeals, potentially overturning the ruling of a floor

                        <br></ul>
<br>
<br>If necessary, the Head Judge may temporarily transfer his or her 
duties to any judge if he or she is unable to fulfill them for a period 
of time. Also, in exceptional circumstances where the tournament’s 
integrity will be damaged, the Tournament Organizer may replace the Head
 Judge.
<br>
<br>Certain premier tournaments have multiple Head Judges and/or 
different Head Judges for different portions of the tournament. All Head
 Judges share the same responsibilities and exercise the same authority 
while they are serving as a Head Judge.</span></span>

<br> 
<br>Judges will not generally assist players in determining the current 
game state but can answer questions about the rules, interactions 
between cards, or provide the Oracle™ wordings of relevant cards. At 
Regular REL, the judge may assist the player in understanding the game

 question away from the table, the request will usually be honored. 
Players may not request specific judges to answer their calls, but may 
request a tournament official to help translate. This request may be 
honored at the discretion of the original judge.

<br>Judges do not intervene in a game to prevent illegal actions, but do
 intervene as soon as a rule has been broken or to prevent a situation

 match consists of a series of games that are played until one side has 
won a set number of games, usually two. Drawn games do not count toward 
this goal. If the round ends before a player has won the required number
 of games, the winner of the match is the player who has won the most 
games at that point. If both players have equal game wins, the match is a
 draw. 
<br>
<br>The Tournament Organizer may change the required number of games to 
be won for any portion of the tournament as long as this choice is 
announced before the tournament begins. Match results, not individual 
game results, are reported to the DCI for inclusion in Planeswalker

			    <span id="_ucRuleBookSelector__ucRuleBook_dlRules_ctl15_lblRuleTextData"><span class="namedrule">For
 the first game of a match, the winner of a random method (such as a die
 roll or coin toss) chooses either to play first or to play second. The 
winner must state this choice before looking at his or her hand. If the 
winner states no choice, it is assumed that he or she is playing first. 
The player who plays first skips the draw step of his or her first turn.
 This is referred to as the play/draw rule. 
<br>
<br>After each game in a match, the loser of that game decides whether 
to play first in the next game. They may wait until after sideboarding 
to make the decision. If the previous game was a draw, the player who 
decided to play or draw at the beginning of the drawn game chooses.
<br>
<br>In certain Premier tournament playoff matches (<b>Magic: The Gathering</b> Players Championship, World <b>Magic</b> Cup, World <b>Magic</b>
 Cup Qualifiers, Pro Tour, Pro Tour Qualifier, and Grand Prix), a 
different play/draw rule is used. In these playoff matches, the player 
that was ranked higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first 
or to play second in the <i>first</i> game of each match. For the second
 and subsequent games, the loser of the previous game decides whether to
 play first in the next game. This alternate play/draw rule may be used 
in other tournament playoff matches. If used, this must be announced 
prior to the start of the tournament.</span></span>

affect this. Team tournaments featuring multiple players playing 
together (such as Two-Headed Giant) use three turns instead of five.
<br>
<br>If the game is incomplete at the end of additional turns, the game is considered a draw.

<br>If a judge assigned a time extension (because of a long ruling, deck
 check, or other reason) the end-of-match procedure does not begin until
 the end of the time extension.

<br>In single-elimination rounds, matches may not end in a draw. If all 
players have equal game wins, the player with the highest life total 
wins the current game. In the event all players have equal life totals 
(or are between games and the game wins are tied), the game/match 
continues with an additional state-based action: if a player does not 
have the highest life total, he or she loses the game. Two-Headed Giant 
teams are treated as a single player for determining a game winner.</span></span>

			    <span id="_ucRuleBookSelector__ucRuleBook_dlRules_ctl24_lblRuleTextData"><span class="namedrule">Players
 are allowed to take written notes during a match and may refer to those
 notes while that match is in progress. At the beginning of a match, 
each player’s note sheet must be empty and must remain visible 
throughout the match. Players do not have to explain or reveal notes to 
other players. Judges may ask to see a player’s notes and/or request 
that the player explain his or her notes.
<br>
<br>Players may not refer to other notes, including notes from previous matches, during games.
<br>
<br>Between games, players may refer to a brief set of notes made before
 the match. They are not required to reveal these notes to their 
opponents. These notes must be removed from the play area before the 
beginning of the next game. Excessive quantities of notes (more than a 
sheet or two) are not allowed and may be penalized as slow play.
<br>Players and spectators (exception: authorized press) may not make 
notes while drafting. Players may not reference any outside notes during
 drafting, card pool registration, or deckbuilding.
<br>
<br>Players may refer to Oracle text, either electronically or in paper 
form, at any time. They must do so publicly and in a format (such as 
gatherer.wizards.com, other official Wizards of the Coast sources, or 
printouts of their sources) which contains no other strategic 
information. If a player wishes to view Oracle text in private, he or 
she must as a judge.
<br>
<br>Artistic modifications to cards that indirectly provide minor 
strategic information are acceptable. The Head Judge is the final 
arbiter on what cards and notes are acceptable for a tournament.</span></span>

 Block checklist cards are used to represent double-faced cards. Only 
official checklist cards may be used to represent double-faced cards in a
 deck.
<br>
<br>The use of checklist cards is required if a player has double-faced 
cards in his or her deck and is not using completely opaque sleeves.
<br>
<br>If a player uses a checklist card to represent a double-faced card 
in his or her deck, then all of the double-faced cards in the deck must 
be represented by checklist cards, and double-faced cards in a hidden 
zone are considered to not exist for purposes of determining deck 
legality.
<br>
<br>Each individual checklist card used must have one (and only one) of the items checked.  
<br>
<br>A checklist card is only used while the card it represents is in a 
hidden zone. The card represented by a checklist card is not a playable 
Magic card until the checklist card has been placed in a public zone. 
Multiple checklists cannot be used to represent a single copy of the 
actual card. For each checklist card used, the player must have a copy 
of the actual card available, though they are not considered sideboard 
cards and are not presented to their opponent.</span></span>

 official text of any card is the Oracle text corresponding to the name 
of the card. Players have the right to request access to the official 
wording of a card only if they can uniquely identify that card, although
 the card does not necessarily have to be identified by name. That 
request will be honored if logistically possible. Identifying a 
double-faced or flip card by either name on it is acceptable, as long as
 the ability that requires the name does not refer to an object on the 
battlefield.
<br>
<br>Players may not use errors or omissions in Oracle to abuse the 
rules. The Head Judge is the final authority for card interpretations, 
and he or she may overrule Oracle if an error is discovered.

<br>Certain cards refer to “a (card or cards) you own from outside the 
game.” In tournament play, a card “you own from outside the game" is a

			    <span id="_ucRuleBookSelector__ucRuleBook_dlRules_ctl37_lblRuleTextData"><span class="namedrule">Decks
 must be randomized at the start of every game and whenever an 
instruction requires it. Randomization is defined as bringing the deck 
to a state where no player can have any information regarding the order 
or position of cards in any portion of the deck. Pile shuffling alone is
 not sufficiently random.
<br>
<br>Once the deck is randomized, it must be presented to an opponent. By
 this action, players state that their decks are legal and randomized. 
The opponent may then shuffle it additionally. Cards and sleeves must 
not be in danger of being damaged during this process. If the opponent 
does not believe the player made a reasonable effort to randomize his or
 her deck, the opponent must notify a judge. Players may request to have
 a judge shuffle their cards rather than the opponent; this request will
 be honored only at a judge’s discretion.
<br> 
<br>If a player has had the opportunity to see any of the card faces of 
the deck being shuffled, the deck is no longer considered randomized and
 must be randomized again.
<br>
<br>At Competitive and Professional REL tournaments, players are 
required to shuffle their opponents’ decks after their owners have 
shuffled them. The Head Judge can require this at Regular REL 
tournaments as well.</span></span>

			    <span id="_ucRuleBookSelector__ucRuleBook_dlRules_ctl38_lblRuleTextData"><span class="namedrule">Players
 may use plastic card sleeves or other protective devices on cards. If a
 player chooses to use card sleeves, all sleeves must be identical and 
all cards in his or her deck must be placed in the sleeves in an 
identical manner. If the sleeves feature holograms or other similar 
markings, cards must be inserted into the sleeves so these markings 
appear only on the faces of the cards.
<br>
<br>During a match, a player may request that a judge inspect an 
opponent’s card sleeves. The judge may disallow the card sleeves if he 
or she believes they are marked, worn, or otherwise in a condition or of
 a design that interferes with shuffling or game play. In the interest 
of efficiency, the judge may choose to delay any change of sleeves until
 the end of the match.
<br>
<br>Competitive and Professional REL tournaments impose additional 
restrictions on sleeves. Highly reflective backs are not allowed; 
sleeves with artwork on their backs are only acceptable if there is a 
single color at the sleeves’ edges; sleeves with holograms across some 
or all of the sleeve front or back are not allowed.
<br>
<br>When using sleeves on double-faced cards, sleeves must be completely
 opaque. The Head Judge is the final authority on what sleeves are 
allowed.</span></span>

 are responsible for ensuring that their cards and/or card sleeves are 
not marked during the course of the tournament. A card or sleeve is 
considered marked if it bears something that makes it possible to 
identify the card without seeing its face, including scratches, 
discoloration, and bends.
<br>
<br>If a player’s cards are sleeved, the cards must be examined while in
 the sleeves to determine if they are marked. Players should use care 
when sleeving their decks and should randomize their decks prior to 
sleeving them to reduce the possibility of cards becoming marked with a 
pattern. Players should also keep in mind that cards or sleeves may 
become worn and potentially marked through play during the course of a 
tournament.
<br>
<br>The Head Judge has the authority to determine if a card in a 
player’s deck is marked. Judges may request that a player remove his or 
her current sleeves or replace any of the deck’s current sleeves 
immediately, or before the next round.
<br>
<br>If a player is required to replace a card in his or her deck and is 
unable to find a replacement, the player may replace the card with a 
basic land card of his or her choice. Once the player does this, he or 
she may not revert back to the original configuration, even if the 
player finds an acceptable replacement. This also applies to cards 
<br>that are lost.</span></span>

 sideboard is a group of additional cards the player may use to modify 
his or her deck between games of a match. The player may use these cards
 in his or her main deck during all games after the first one in a 
match. Other items (token cards, double-faced card represented in the 
deck by a checklist card, etc) should be kept separate from the 
sideboard during game play.
<br>
<br>Before the beginning of the second or subsequent game in a match, 
players may change the composition of their deck by exchanging cards 
from their deck for cards in their sideboard. If players restart a game 
due to an in-game effect, the composition of their decks must remain the
 same for the restarted game. 
<br>
<br>Before each game begins, players must present their sideboard (if 
any) face down and, if requested, allow their opponents to count the 
number of cards in their sideboard. Players are not required to reveal 
how many cards they have swapped from their main deck to their 
sideboard. 
<br>
<br>During a game, players may look at their own sideboard and the 
sideboard of any players they currently control. The sideboard must 
remain clearly distinguishable from other cards.
<br>
<br>The deck and sideboard must each be returned to their original compositions before the first game of each match.
<br>
<br>Restrictions on the composition and use of a sideboard can be found 
in the deck construction rules for a particular format type. 
<br>
<br>If a penalty causes a player to lose the first game in a match 
before that game has begun, or the first game is intentionally drawn 
before any cards are played, neither player may use cards from his or 
her sideboard for the next game in the match. </span></span>

			    <span id="_ucRuleBookSelector__ucRuleBook_dlRules_ctl45_lblRuleTextData"><span class="namedrule">Communication
 between players is essential to the successful play of any game that 
involves virtual objects or hidden information. While bluffing may be an
 aspect of games, there need to be clear lines as to what is, and is 
not, acceptable for players to say or otherwise represent. Officials and
 highly competitive players should understand the line between bluffing 
and fraud. This will confirm expectations of both sporting and 
competitive players during a game. 
<br>
<br>The philosophy of the DCI is that a player should have an advantage 
due to better understanding of the rules of a game, greater awareness of
 the interactions in the current game state, and superior tactical 
planning. Players are under no obligation to assist their opponents in 
playing the game. Regardless of anything else, players are expected to 
treat their opponents politely and with respect. Failure to do so may 
lead to Unsporting Conduct penalties. 
<br>
<br>There are three categories of information: free, derived and private.
<br>
<br>Free information is information to which all players are entitled 
access without contamination or omissions made by their opponents. If a 
player is ever unable or unwilling to provide free information to an 
opponent that has requested it, he or she should call a judge and 
explain the situation. Free information includes:
<br><ul>
                        <li>Details of current game actions and past game actions that still affect the game state.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>The name of any object in a public zone.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>The type of any counter in a public zone.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>The physical status (tapped/flipped/unattached/phased) and current zone of any object.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Player life totals, poison counter totals, and the game score of the current match.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>The current step and/or phase and which player(s) are active</li>
                    </ul>
<br>Derived information is information to which all players are entitled access, but opponents are not obliged to assist 
<br>in determining and may require some skill or calculation to determine. Derived information includes:
<br><ul>
                        <li>The number of any type of objects present in any game zone.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>All characteristics of objects in public zones that are not defined as free information.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Game Rules, Tournament Policy, Oracle content and any other
                            official information pertaining to the current tournament. Cards are
                            considered to have their Oracle text printed on them.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
<br>Private information is information to which players have access only
 if they are able to determine it from the current visual game state or 
their own record of previous game actions.
<br><ul>
                        <li>Any information that is not free or derived is automatically private information.</li>
                    </ul>
<br>The following rules govern player communication:
<br><ul>
                        <li>Players must answer all questions asked of them by a judge
                            completely and honestly, regardless of the type of information
                            requested. Players may request to do so away from the match.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Players may not represent derived or free information incorrectly.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Players must answer completely and honestly any specific questions pertaining to free
                            information.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>At Regular REL, all derived information is instead considered free.</li>
                    </ul>
<br>Judges are encouraged to help players in determining free 
information, but must avoid assisting players with derived information

 tournament shortcut is an action taken by players to skip parts of the 
technical play sequence without explicitly announcing them. Tournament 
shortcuts are essential for the smooth play of a game, as they allow 
players to play in a clear fashion without getting bogged down in the 
minutia of the rules. Most tournament shortcuts involve skipping one or 
more priority passes to the mutual understanding of all players; if a 
player wishes to demonstrate or use a new tournament shortcut entailing 
any number of priority passes, he or she must be clear where the game 
state will end up as part of the request.
<br>
<br>A player may interrupt a tournament shortcut by explaining how he or
 she is deviating from it or at which point in the middle he or she 
wishes to take an action. A player may interrupt their own shortcut in 
this manner. A player is not allowed to use a previously undeclared 
tournament shortcut, or to modify an in-use tournament shortcut without 
announcing the modification, in order to create ambiguity in the game.

<br>A player may not request priority and take no action with it. If a 
player decides he or she does not wish to do anything, the request is 
nullified and priority is returned to the player that originally had it.
<br>
<br>Certain conventional tournament shortcuts used in Magic are detailed
 below. If a player wishes to deviate from these, he or she should be 
explicit about doing so. Note that some of these are exceptions to the 
policy above in that they do cause non-explicit priority passes.
<br>
<br><ul>
                        <li>The statement "Go" (and equivalents such as "Your turn" and
                            "Done") offers to keep passing priority until an opponent has priority
                            in the end step. Opponents are assumed to be acting then unless they
                            specify otherwise.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>A statement such as "I'm ready for combat" or "Declare
                            attackers?" offers to keep passing priority until an opponent has
                            priority in the beginning of combat step. Opponents are assumed to be
                            acting then unless they specify otherwise.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Whenever a player adds an object to the stack, he or she is
                            assumed to be passing priority unless he or she explicitly announces
                            that he or she intends to retain it. If he or she adds a group of
                            objects to the stack without explicitly retaining priority and a player
                            wishes to take an action at a point in the middle, the actions should be
                            reversed up to that point.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>"No attacks" or similar statements by the active player during
                            combat offers to pass priority until an opponent has priority in the end
                            of combat step.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>If a player casts a spell or activates an ability with X in its
                            mana cost without specifying the value of X, it is assumed to be for all
                            mana currently available in his or her pool.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>If a player casts a spell or activates an ability and announces
                            choices for it that are not normally made until resolution, the player
                            must adhere to those choices unless an opponent responds to that spell
                            or ability. If an opponent inquires about choices made during
                            resolution, that player is assumed to be passing priority and allowing
                            that spell or ability to resolve.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>A player is assumed to have paid any cost of 0 unless he or she announces otherwise.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>A player who casts a spell or activates an ability that targets
                            an object on the stack is assumed to target the legal target closest to
                            the top of the stack unless the player specifies otherwise.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>A player is assumed to be attacking another player and not any
                            planeswalkers that player may control unless the attacking player
                            specifies otherwise.

                        <br>
                        <li>A player who chooses a planeswalker as the target of a spell or
                            ability that would deal damage is assumed to be targeting the
                            planeswalker’s controller and redirecting the damage on resolution. The
                            player must adhere to that choice unless an opponent responds.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>In the Two-Headed Giant format, attacking creatures are assumed
                            to be assigning combat damage to the defending team's primary head,
                            unless the creature's controller specifies otherwise.

			    <span id="_ucRuleBookSelector__ucRuleBook_dlRules_ctl47_lblRuleTextData"><span class="namedrule">Due to the complexity of accurately representing a game of <b>Magic</b>,
 it is acceptable for players to engage in a block of actions that, 
while technically in an incorrect order, arrive at a legal and clearly 
understood game state once they are complete.
<br>
<br>All actions taken must be legal if they were executed in the correct
 order, and any opponent can ask the player to do the actions in the 
correct sequence so that he or she can respond at the appropriate time 
(at which point players will not be held to any still-pending actions).
<br>
<br>An out-of-order sequence must not result in a player prematurely 
gaining information which could reasonably affect decisions made later 
in that sequence.
<br>
<br>Players may not try to use opponent's reactions to some portion of 
an out-of-order sequence to see if he or she should modify actions or 
try to take additional ones. Nor may players use out-of-order sequencing
 to try to retroactively take an action they missed at the appropriate 
time. In general, any substantial pause at the end of a completed batch 
is an indication that all actions have been taken, the sequence is 
complete and the game has moved to the appropriate point at the end of 
the sequence.

<br><i>Examples:</i>
<br><ol>
                        <li>A player discards a card to pay for Masticore’s upkeep cost before untapping his or her

 decision to drop, concede, or agree to an intentional draw cannot be 
made in exchange for or influenced by the offer of any reward or 
incentive. Making such an offer is prohibited. Unless the player 
receiving such an offer calls for a judge immediately, both players will
 be penalized in the same manner.
<br>
<br>Players are allowed to share prizes they have not yet received in 
the current tournament as they wish and may agree as such before or 
during their match, as long as any such sharing does not occur in 
exchange for any game or match result or the dropping of a player from 
the tournament. As an exception, players in the announced last round of 
the single-elimination portion of a tournament may agree to divide 
tournament prizes as they wish. In that case, one of the players at each
 table must agree to drop from the tournament. Players are then awarded 
prizes according to their resulting ranking. Such an agreement may never
 include a concession or an intentional draw.
<br>
<br>The result of a match or game may not be randomly or arbitrarily 
determined through any means other than the normal progress of the game 
in play. Examples include (but are not limited to) rolling a die, 
flipping a coin, arm wrestling, or playing any other game. 
<br>
<br>Players may not reach an agreement in conjunction with other 
matches. Players can make use of information regarding match or game 
scores of other tables. However, players are not allowed to leave their 
seats during their match or go to great lengths to obtain this 
information. 
<br>
<br>Players in the single-elimination rounds of a tournament offering 
only cash and/or unopened product as prizes may, with the permission of 
the Tournament Organizer, agree to split the prizes evenly. The players 
may end the tournament at that point, or continue to play with only 
ratings points at stake. All players still in the tournament must agree 
to the arrangement. 
<br>
<br><i>Example</i>: Before the semifinals of a tournament (in which 
first place gets 12 packs, second place gets 8 packs and 3rd and 4th get
 4 packs each) begins, the players may get permission from the 
tournament Organizer to end the tournament, with each player receiving 7
 packs.
<br>
<br><i>Example</i>: In the finals of a 1-slot Pro Tour Qualifier that 
offers a travel award and an invitation to the winner, the two finalists
 may agree to split the tournament prizes, but this agreement cannot 
alter the results of the match. One player must drop from the 
tournament, leaving the travel award and the invitation to the player 
who did not drop from the tournament. That player is then free to split 
the remainder of the prizes as agreed upon. The travel award and 
invitation are a single item and may not be split.</span></span>

 There are no restrictions on the number of cards a player may exchange

 without being required to return their deck to its original composition
 before their next match. The Head Judge or Tournament Organizer must

			    <span id="_ucRuleBookSelector__ucRuleBook_dlRules_ctl68_lblRuleTextData"><span class="namedrule">Cards
 must be received directly from tournament officials. This product must 
be new and previously unopened. Some Pro Tour, Grand Prix, and National 
Championship events may have had boosters opened in order to stamp them.
 Each player (or team) must be given exactly the same quantity and type 
of product as all other players participating in the tournament. For 
example, if one player receives three <i>Return to Ravnica</i> boosters for a booster draft, all other players must also receive three <i>Return
                        to Ravnica</i> boosters.
<br>
<br>Other than basic land, only cards from the expansions of the 
boosters opened (and only cards opened in that player’s pool) may be 
used in a player’s deck. For example, in a <i><b>Magic</b> 2011</i> Sealed Deck tournament, any card in a booster other then the <i><b>Magic</b>
                        2011</i> game cards received by the player and basic land may not be used in a player’s deck during that tournament.
<br>
<br>The DCI recommends that 6 boosters per player are used for 
individual format Sealed Deck tournaments and 3 boosters per player are 
used for individual Booster or Team Rochester Draft tournaments. For the
 recommended product mix for the current block, refer to Appendix D.
<br> 
<br>If the Tournament Organizer allows players to provide their own 
product, that product must be pooled with the rest of the product for 
the tournament and randomly distributed. Players are not considered to 
own the cards until the tournament finishes or they legally drop. 
<br>
<br>Players may use only the cards they receive or draft and basic land 
cards provided by the Tournament Organizer. Players may ask a judge for 
permission to replace a card with an exact copy.
<br>
<br>If the Tournament Organizer is not providing basic land cards for 
use in a Limited tournament, he or she must announce this before 
tournament registration. Tournament Organizers may require players to 
return basic land cards when they leave the tournament. If the 
Tournament Organizer does not have sufficient basic land cards, players 
may use their own during the tournament as long as they are in good 
condition and are not marked.
<br>
<br>Players may add an unlimited number of basic land cards to their 
decks during deck construction. They may not add additional snow land 
cards (e.g. Snow-Covered Forest, etc), even in formats in which they are
 legal.</span></span>

 Sealed Deck tournaments, the Head Judge may require players to perform a
 deck swap prior to deck construction. Players receive unopened product 
and register the contents (except non-foil basic land cards) on 
decklists. Foil basic land cards must be registered and kept with the 
registered card pool. Any card in a booster 
<br>that is not a card from the expansion of the opened booster is 
retained by the player that registers the cards (e.g., a player that 
registers the contents of a booster during a deck swap keeps the token 
card, if any). Players who drop from the tournament before fulfilling 
this duty will receive a match loss in the first round. Tournament 
officials then collect the recorded card pools and redistribute them 
randomly. A player may randomly receive the product he or she 
registered. The Head Judge should require players to sort the cards they
 register according to some criteria (e.g. by color and then 
alphabetically) to assist the player receiving the pool. </span></span>

 Booster Draft and Team Rochester Draft tournaments, players assemble 
into random drafting circles (called pods) of roughly equal size at the 
direction of the Head Judge. Tournament officials then distribute 
identical sets of booster packs to each player.
<br>
<br>Players within a pod may play only against other players within that
 pod. In Regular REL tournaments, the Tournament Organizer may elect to 
lift this restriction. This must be announced before the tournament 
starts.
<br>
<br>Players may not communicate in any way with, or reveal hidden 
information to, other individuals during a draft, apart from tournament 
officials. This applies as soon as the draft pod pairings are posted and
 lasts until players hand in their decklists. </span></span>

			    <span id="_ucRuleBookSelector__ucRuleBook_dlRules_ctl72_lblRuleTextData"><span class="namedrule">All
 players must open and draft the same type of booster at the same time. 
Players open their first booster pack and count the cards face down, 
removing token cards, rules cards, and any other non-game cards. Players
 who receive an erroneous number of cards at any time must immediately 
notify a judge. After picking up the booster, 
<br>players should remove and keep any non-foil basic land cards and/or 
any other cards that are not from the expansion of the opened booster. 
Foil basic land cards should be left in the booster and drafted with the
 other cards. Players choose one card from their current booster pack 
and then pass the remaining cards face down to the player on their left 
until all cards are drafted. Once a player has removed a card from the 
pack and put it on top of his or her single, front face-down drafted 
pile, it is considered selected and may not be returned to the pack.
<br>
<br>Players may not reveal the front face of their card selections or 
the contents of their current packs to other participants in the draft 
and must make a reasonable effort to keep that information from the 
sight of other players. Players are not permitted to reveal hidden 
information of any kind to other participants in the draft regarding 
their own picks or what they want others to pick. (Exception: This does 
not apply to double-faced cards, both faces of which may be revealed at 
any time during a draft.)
<br>
<br>Players and teams may not look at their drafted cards between or 
during picks at Competitive and Professional RELs. At Regular REL, 
players are allowed to review their drafted cards between or during 
picks as long as they are holding no other cards at the same time. The 
Head Judge may choose to disallow this provided he or she announces it 
before the first draft. Between boosters there is a review period in 
which players may review their picks.
<br>
<br>If the draft is not being timed, and two players do not wish to make
 a pick before the other player, the player closer to providing the 
other player with the pack picks first.
<br>
<br>If the players are equidistant, then the player in the lower seat 
number picks first. After the first pack is drafted and the review 
period completed, players open the next pack and draft in the same 
fashion, except that the direction of drafting is reversed—it now 
proceeds to the right. This process is repeated, reversing the direction
 of drafting for each booster pack until all cards in all booster packs 
are drafted.
<br>
<br>If a player is unable or unwilling to continue drafting, he or she 
is suspended from drafting and must construct a deck from whatever cards
 he or she has drafted thus far. For the remainder of the current 
booster pack, a tournament official randomly makes picks instead of the 
suspended player.</span></span>

			    <span id="_ucRuleBookSelector__ucRuleBook_dlRules_ctl78_lblRuleTextData"><span class="namedrule">Team
 Rochester Draft tournaments require teams of three players each. Two 
teams are seated at each table for the draft. Team members sit clockwise
 in A-B-C order around the table. (For example, in a three-person team 
tournament, players sit around the table clockwise in this order: 1A, 
1B, 1C, 2A, 2B, 2C.)
<br>
<br>A team determined at random chooses either to pick first or to allow
 the other team to pick first. Player B of the team that picks first 
lays out the first pack.
<br>  
<br>The draft begins with the first player opening his or her first 
booster pack and laying out the entire contents of the pack face up on 
the table as directed by tournament officials, with the cards facing him
 or her. After reviewing the cards, drafting proceeds with each player 
selecting a single card in turn. Once a player has selected a card and 
placed it with his or her other drafted cards, he or she may not select a
 different card. If a player fails to select a 
<br>card in the time given, a tournament official selects for that 
player the “oldest” card still remaining from the booster pack (the card
 on the table the longest).
<br>
<br>The player drafting first from the cards presented on the table is 
called the active player. The first active player is the participant who
 opened the first booster of the draft, as designated by a tournament 
official. All players in each drafting pod serve as the active player 
once for each group of booster packs. The identity of the active player 
moves in a horseshoe pattern, clockwise for the first and third boosters
 and counter-clockwise for the second. The player who was last to open a
 booster pack from a group is the first to open the booster pack from 
the next group.
<br>
<br>The draft order also begins moving in a horseshoe pattern, clockwise
 for the first and third boosters and counter-clockwise for the second, 
beginning with the active player, continuing around the table to the 
last player in the group to draft a card. The last player in the group 
selects two cards sequentially, and then drafting continues in reverse 
order, moving back to the player who began the drafting. If there are 
still cards remaining, the player who began the drafting selects two 
cards, and drafting continues again in the opposite direction.
<br>
<br>Example: Team 1 and Team 2 are seated around a table. They are 
numbered 1A-1B-1C-2A-2B-2C in a clockwise order. Team 2 wins the coin 
toss, and the members of Team 2 choose to let Team 1 pick first. The 
active player for the first pack is Player 1B. The first booster pack 
for Player 1B is opened and placed face up in front of Player 1B. After 
the 20-second review period has expired, the draft order is as follows: 
<br>
<br>Player 1B—card 1 
<br>Player 1C—card 2 
<br>Player 2A—card 3 
<br>Player 2B—card 4 
<br>Player 2C—card 5
<br>Player 1A—card 6 
<br>Player 1A—card 7 
<br>Player 2C—card 8 
<br>Player 2B—card 9 
<br>Player 2A—card 10
<br>Player 1C—card 11 
<br>Player 1B—card 12 
<br>Player 1B—card 13 
<br>Player 1C—card 14 
<br>Player 2A—card 15
<br>
<br>During card selection, players must display the most recent card 
they drafted from the current pack. At all other times, players may 
leave one of their drafted cards face up on their draft pile, or may 
leave all cards face down. Players may not review their draft picks 
while drafting proceeds or at any other time specifically indicated by 
tournament officials.</span></span>

<br>
<br>The DCI recommends that eight boosters per team are used for 
two-person team tournaments, and twelve boosters per team for 
three-person team tournaments. For the recommended product mix for the

next to each other. Tournament officials then distribute identical 
booster packs to each team in the pod. 
<br>
<br>After opening and counting the cards in their first pack, the team 
chooses two cards from the booster pack then passes the remaining cards 
face down to the team on its left. Selected cards may be placed into one
 or two piles. The cards chosen are not assigned to a particular player;
 they become part of a pool out of which both players will build their 
decks. The open packs are passed around the drafting pod—with each team 
taking two cards from each before passing—until all cards are drafted.
<br>
<br>For the second pack, the direction of drafting is reversed as usual.

			    <span id="_ucRuleBookSelector__ucRuleBook_dlRules_ctl92_lblRuleTextData"><span class="namedrule">Unless
 otherwise announced, tournaments are assumed to follow the Swiss 
pairing algorithm. Some tournaments may proceed to single-elimination 
playoff rounds between the top 2, 4, or 8 (or other number) players 
after the Swiss rounds are over. The Swiss pairing algorithm is modified
 in Booster Draft tournaments as explained in section 7.6.
<br>
<br>For constructed tournaments that have a single-elimination playoff 
(or sealed deck tournaments that do not use a booster draft for the 
playoff), the recommended pairing method is to pair the playoff players 
by the final Swiss standings.
<br>
<br>For an 8-player playoff, the 1st place player plays the 8th place 
player, the 2nd place player plays the 7th place player, the 3rd place 
player plays the 6th place player, and the 4th place player plays the 
5th place player. The winners of the 1st/8th place and 4th/5th place 
matches play each other in the next round of the playoff. The winners of
 the 2nd/7th place and 3rd/6th place matches play each other in the next
 round of the playoff. The remaining players play in the last round of 
the playoff.
<br>
<br>For a 4-player playoff, the 1st place player plays the 4th place 
player, and the 2nd place player plays the 3rd place player. The 
remaining players play in the last round of the playoff.
<br>
<br>For Limited tournaments that have a single-elimination booster draft
 playoffs, it is recommend that only an 8-player playoff is run using 
the following the method described below.
<br>
<br>Use a random method to seat players around the draft table and conduct the draft.
<br><pre>8  1  2
<br>7     3
<br>6  5  4</pre>After the draft has concluded, the player in seat 1 
plays the player in seat 5, the player in seat 2 plays the player in 
seat 6, the player in seat 3 plays the player in seat 7, and the player 
in seat 4 plays the player in seat 8. The winners of the seat 1/5 and 
the 3/7 matches play each other in the next round of the playoff. The 
winners of the seat 2/6 and the seat 4/8 matches play each other in the 
next round of the playoff. The remaining players play in the last round 
of the playoff.
<br>
<br>For Premier Events, the playoff options above are required, not optional.
<br>
<br>Premier Events include the following events: <b>Magic: The Gathering</b> Players Championship, World <b>Magic</b> Cup, World <b>Magic</b> Cup Qualifiers, Pro Tour, Pro Tour Qualifier, Grand Prix, Grand Prix Trial, WPN Premium Tournament, and WPN Premium Qualifier.

match loss and 1 match point for each match ending in a draw. Players 
receiving byes are considered to have won the match.
<br><ul>
                    <li>A player's record is 6–2–0 (Wins–Losses–Draws). That player has 18 match points (6*3, 2*0,
                        0*1).
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>A player's record is 4–2–2. That player has 14 match points (4*3, 2*0, 2*1).</li>
                </ul>
<br><b>Game Points</b>
<br>Game points are similar to match points in that players earn 3 game 
points for each game they win and 1 point for each game that ends in a 
draw, and 0 points for any game lost. Unfinished games are considered 
draws. Unplayed games are worth 0 points.
<br><ul>
                    <li>A player wins a match 2–0–0, so she earns 6 game points and her opponent receives 0 game points
                        from the match.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>A player wins a match 2–1–0, so she earns 6 game points and her opponent earns 3 game points
                        from the match.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>A player wins a match 2–0–1, so he earns 7 game points and his opponent earns 1 game point from
                        the match.
                    </li>
                </ul>
<br><b>Match-win percentage</b>
<br>A player’s match-win percentage is that player’s accumulated match 
points divided by the total match points possible in those rounds 
(generally, 3 times the number of rounds played). If this number is 
lower than 0.33, use 0.33 instead. The minimum match-win percentage of 
0.33 limits the effect low performances have when calculating and 
comparing opponents’ match-win percentage.
<br>
<br><b>Game-win percentage</b>
<br>Similar to the match-win percentage, a player’s game-win percentage 
is the total number of game points he or she earned divided by the total
 game points possible (generally, 3 times the number of games played). 
Again, use 0.33 if the actual game-win percentage is lower than that.
<br>
<br><b>Opponents’ match-win percentage</b>
<br>A player’s opponents’ match-win percentage is the average match-win 
percentage of each opponent that player faced (ignoring those rounds for
 which the player received a bye). Use the match-win percentage 
definition listed above when calculating each individual opponent’s 
match-win percentage.
<br>
<br><b>Opponents’ game-win percentages</b>
<br>Similar to opponents’ match-win percentage, a player’s opponents’ 
game-win percentage is simply the average game-win percentage of all of 
that player’s opponents. And, as with opponents’ match-win percentage, 
each opponent has a minimum game-win percentage of 0.33.  
<br>
<br><b>Byes</b> 
<br>When a player is assigned a bye for a round, he or she is considered to have won the match 2–0.
<br>
<br>Thus, that player earns 3 match points and 6 game points. A player’s
 byes are ignored when computing his or her opponents’ match-win and 
opponents’ game-win percentages.</span></span>

MAGIC INFRACTION PROCEDURE GUIDE
<p>
Effective July 14, 2017
</p><p>
INTRODUCTION
</p><p>
The Magic- Infraction Procedure Guide provides judges the appropriate 
penalties and procedures to handle rules violations that occur during a 
tournament held at Competitive or Professional Rules Enforcement Level 
(REL), as well as the underlying philosophy that guides their 
implementation. It exists to protect players from potential misconduct 
and to protect the integrity of the tournament itself.
</p><p>
Rules violations usually require a penalty or they are unenforceable. Tournaments run at Regular REL
</p><p>
use the Judging at Regular REL document.
</p><p>
FRAMEWORK OF THIS DOCUMENT
</p><p>
This document is divided into two major parts: General Definitions and 
Philosophy (section 1), and Infractions (sections 2-4). Infractions are 
broken down into general classes (Game Play Errors, Tournament Errors, 
and Unsporting Conduct), and further into subclasses for specific 
infractions.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
See the Magic Tournament Rules for further definitions of terms in this document.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
This document is published in multiple languages. If a discrepancy 
exists between the English version and a non-English version of this 
document, tournament participants must refer to the English version to 
settle disputes concerning interpretations of the Infraction Procedure 
Guide.

<a name="1"></a></p><h4>1  GENERAL PHILOSOPHY</h4>
Judges are neutral arbiters and enforcers of policy and rules. A judge 
shouldn't intervene in a game unless he or she believes a rules 
violation has occurred, a player with a concern or question requests 
assistance, or the judge wishes to prevent a situation from escalating. 
Judges don't stop play errors from occurring, but instead deal with 
errors that have occurred, penalize those who violate rules or policy, 
and promote fair play and sporting conduct by example and diplomacy.
<p>
Judges may intervene to prevent or preempt errors occurring outside of a
 game. Knowledge of a player's history or skill does not alter an 
infraction, but it may be taken into account during an investigation.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
The purpose of a penalty is to educate the player not to make similar 
mistakes in the future. This is done through both an explanation of 
where the rules or policies were violated and a penalty to reinforce the
 education. Penalties are also for the deterrence and education of every
 other player in the event and are also used to track player behavior 
over time.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
If a minor violation is quickly handled by the players to their mutual 
satisfaction, a judge does not need to intervene. If the players are 
playing in a way that is clear to both players, but might cause 
confusion to an external observer, judges are encouraged to request that
 the players make the situation clear, but not assess an infraction or 
issue any penalty. In both these situations, the judge should ensure 
that the game progresses normally. More significant violations are 
addressed by first identifying what infraction applies, then proceeding 
with the corresponding instructions.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Only the Head Judge is authorized to issue penalties that deviate from 
these guidelines. The Head Judge may not deviate from this guide's 
procedures except in significant and exceptional circumstances or a 
situation that has no applicable philosophy for guidance. Significant 
and exceptional circumstances are rare-a table collapses, a booster 
contains cards from a different set, etc. The Rules Enforcement Level, 
round of the tournament, age or experience-level of the player, desire 
to educate the player, and certification level of the judge are NOT 
exceptional circumstances. If another judge feels deviation is 
appropriate, he or she must consult with the Head Judge.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Judges are human and make mistakes. When a judge makes a mistake, he or 
she should acknowledge the mistake, apologize to the players, and fix it
 if it is not too late. If a member of the tournament staff gives a 
player erroneous information that causes them to commit a violation, the
 Head Judge is authorized to downgrade the penalty. For example, a 
player asks a judge whether a card is legal for a format and is told 
yes. When that player's deck is found to be illegal because of these 
cards, the Head Judge applies the normal procedure for fixing the 
decklist, but may downgrade the penalty to a Warning because of the 
direct error of the judge.
</p><p>
<a name="1.1"></a></p><h4>1.1 DEFINITION OF PENALTIES</h4>
<p>
Warning
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
A Warning is an officially tracked penalty. Warnings are used in 
situations of incorrect play when a small amount of time is needed to 
implement the corrective procedure. The purpose of a Warning is to alert
 judges and players involved that a problem has occurred and to keep a 
permanent record of the infraction in the DCI Penalty Database. A time 
extension should be issued if the ruling has taken more than a minute.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Game Loss
</p><p>
A Game Loss is issued in situations where the procedure to correct the 
offense takes a significant amount of time that may slow the entire 
tournament or causes significant disruption to the tournament, or in 
which it is impossible to continue the game due to physical disruption. 
It is also used for some infractions that have a higher probability for a
 player to gain advantage.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
A Game Loss ends the current game immediately and the player who 
committed the infraction is considered to have lost the game for the 
purpose of match reporting. The player receiving a Game Loss chooses 
whether to play or draw in the next game of that match, if applicable. 
If a Game Loss is issued before the match begins, neither player in that
 match may use sideboards (if the tournament uses them) for the first 
game they play.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Game Losses are applied to the game in which the offense occurred unless
 the players have begun a new game or the tournament is between rounds, 
in which case the loss is applied to the player's next game. If 
simultaneous Game Loss penalties are issued to each player, they are 
recorded, but do not affect the match score. If a player receives a Game
 Loss at the same time his or her opponent receives a Match Loss, the 
Game Loss is carried over into the next round.
</p><p>
Match Loss
</p><p>
A Match Loss is a severe penalty that is usually issued when the match 
cannot be completed due to timing restrictions or because the match 
itself has been compromised.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Match Losses are applied to the match during which the offense occurred 
unless the match has already ended, in which case the penalty will be 
applied to the player's next match.
</p><p>
Disqualification
</p><p>
A Disqualification is issued for activity that damages the integrity of a
 tournament as a whole or for severe unsporting conduct.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
The recipient of a Disqualification does not need to be a player in the 
tournament. He or she may be a spectator or other bystander. If this 
happens, he or she must be entered into the tournament in Wizards Event 
Reporter (WER) so that he or she may be disqualified and reported to the
 DCI.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Disqualification can occur without proof of action so long as the Head 
Judge determines sufficient information exists to believe the 
tournament's integrity may have been compromised.
</p><p>
It is recommended that the Head Judge's report reflect this fact.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
When this penalty is applied, the player loses his or her current match 
and is dropped from the tournament. If a player has already received 
prizes at the time he or she is disqualified, that player may keep those
 prizes but does not receive any additional prizes or awards he or she 
may be due. A player that is disqualified from a tournament does not 
receive Planeswalker Points or Professional Points for that tournament.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
When a player is disqualified during a tournament, he or she is removed 
from the tournament and does not take up a place in the standings. This 
means that all players in the tournament will advance one spot in the 
standings and are entitled to any prizes the new standing would offer. 
If the Disqualification takes place after a cut is made, no additional 
players advance in place of the disqualified player although they do 
move up a spot in the standings. For example, if a player is 
disqualified during the quarterfinal round of a Preliminary Pro Tour 
Qualifier, the former 9th place finisher does not advance into the 
single elimination top 8, but he or she does move into 8th place in the 
standings.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
<a name="1.2"></a></p><h4>1.2 APPLYING PENALTIES</h4>
<p>
Penalties are included with the tournament report so that a permanent 
record can be kept in the DCI Penalty Database. Additionally, any 
penalty of Game Loss or higher should be reported to the Head Judge, and
 it is recommended that only the Head Judge issue penalties of this 
nature (with the exception of Tardiness (3.1) and Deck Errors (3.5)).
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Being enrolled in the tournament is not a requirement to receive a 
penalty. Although these guidelines refer to players, other people in the
 venue, such as spectators, staff, or judges may be enrolled into (and 
dropped from) the tournament in order to receive a penalty. Penalties 
are still issued even if a player drops from the tournament before it 
would take effect.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Any time a penalty is issued, the judge must explain the infraction, the
 procedure for fixing the situation, and the penalty to all players 
involved. If the Head Judge chooses to deviate from the Infraction 
Procedure Guide, the Head Judge is expected to explain the standard 
penalty and the reason for deviation.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Some infractions include remedies to handle the offense beyond the base 
penalty. These procedures exist to protect officials from accusations of
 unfairness, bias, or favoritism. If a judge makes a ruling that is 
consistent with quoted text, then the complaints of a player shift from 
accusation of unfairness by the judge to accusations of unfair policy. 
Deviations from these procedures may raise accusations against the judge
 from the player(s) involved, or from those who hear about it. These 
procedures do not, and should not, take into account the game being 
played, the current situation that the game is in, or who will benefit 
strategically from the procedure associated with a penalty. While it is 
tempting to try to fix game situations, the danger of missing a subtle 
detail or showing favoritism to a player (even unintentionally) makes it
 a bad idea.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
If an error leads to multiple related infractions, only issue one with the most severe penalty.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
<a name="1.3"></a></p><h4>1.3 RANDOMIZING A LIBRARY</h4>
<p>
The remedy for some infractions in this document includes shuffling the 
randomized portion of the library. This requires first determining 
whether any portion of the library is non-random, such as cards that 
have been manipulated on the top or bottom of the library, and 
separating those.
</p><p>
Check with both players to verify this, and check the graveyard, exile, 
and battlefield for library manipulation cards, such as Brainstorm and 
cards with the scry mechanic. Once the library has been shuffled, any 
manipulated cards are returned to their correct locations.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Shuffles performed by a judge as part of a remedy are not considered shuffles for game purposes.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
<a name="1.4"></a></p><h4>1.4 BACKING UP</h4>
<p>
Some infractions in this document permit the judge to consider the 
possibility of a backup. Due to the amount of information that may 
become available to players and might affect their play, backups are 
regarded as a solution of last resort, only applied in situations where 
leaving the game in the current state is a substantially worse solution.
 A good backup will result in a situation where the gained information 
makes no difference and the line of play remains the same (excepting the
 error, which has been fixed). This means limiting backups to situations
 with minimal decision trees.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Only the Head Judge may authorize a backup. At large tournaments, they 
may choose to delegate this responsibility to Team Leaders.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
To perform a backup, each individual action since the point of the error
 is reversed, starting with the most recent ones and working backwards. 
Every action must be reversed; no parts of the sequence should be 
omitted or reordered. If the identity of a card involved in reversing an
 action is unknown to one of the players (usually because it was drawn),
 a random card is chosen from the possible candidates. Shuffles are 
reversed by a single shuffle of the random portion of the library after 
the rest of the backup is complete. A card that became legally known to 
only one player after the error was committed is not considered random 
and is returned to the appropriate location after the shuffle has been 
completed.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Backups involving random/unknown elements should be approached with 
extreme caution, especially if they cause or threaten to cause a 
situation in which a player will end up with different cards than they 
would once they have correctly drawn those cards. For example, returning
 cards to the library when a player has the ability to shuffle their 
library is not something that should be done except in extreme 
situations.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Some remedies state a simple backup may be performed. A simple backup is
 backing up the last action completed (or one currently in progress) and
 is sometimes used to make another portion of the prescribed remedy 
smoother. A simple backup should not involve any random elements.
</p><p>
<a name="1.5"></a></p><h4>1.5 SETS</h4>
<p>
Some infractions in this document refer to sets of cards. A set is a 
physically distinct group of cards defined by a game rule or effect. It 
may correspond to a specific zone, or may only represent a part of a 
zone. A set may consist of a single card.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Cards are considered to be part of a set until they join another set. 
There is no in-between state and any card that has not yet been seen is 
part of the previous set (unless the new set is hidden).
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
<a name="2"></a></p><h4>2 GAME PLAY ERRORS</h4>
<p>
Game Play Errors are caused by incorrect or inaccurate play of the game 
such that it results in violations of the Magic Comprehensive Rules. 
Many offenses fit into this category and it would be impossible to list 
them all. The guide below is designed to give judges a framework for 
assessing how to handle a Game Play Error.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Most Game Play Error infractions are assumed to have been committed 
unintentionally. If the judge believes that the error was intentional, 
he or she should first consider whether an Unsporting Conduct - Cheating
 infraction has occurred.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
With the exception of Failure to Maintain Game State, which is never 
upgraded, the third or subsequent penalty for a Game Play Error offense 
in the same category is upgraded to a Game Loss. For multi-day 
tournaments, the penalty count for these infractions resets between 
days.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
<a name="2.1"></a></p><h4>2.1 Game Play Error - Missed Trigger</h4>
<table border="1">
<tbody><tr>
<th colspan="1">Penalty</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No Penalty</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>
</p><h4><b>Definition</b></h4>
<p>
A triggered ability triggers, but the player controlling the ability 
doesn't demonstrate awareness of the trigger's existence the first time 
that it would affect the game in a visible fashion.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
The point by which the player needs to demonstrate this awareness depends on the impact that the trigger would have on the game:
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
- A triggered ability that requires its controller to choose targets 
(other than 'target opponent'), modes, or other choices made when the 
ability is put onto the stack: The controller must announce those 
choices before they next pass priority.
</p><p>
- A triggered ability that causes a change in the visible game state 
(including life totals) or requires a choice upon resolution: The 
controller must take the appropriate physical action or acknowledge the 
specific trigger before taking any game actions (such as casting a 
sorcery spell or explicitly taking an action in the next step or phase) 
that can be taken only after the triggered ability should have resolved.
 Note that passing priority, casting an instant spell or activating an 
ability doesn't mean a triggered ability has been forgotten, as it could
 still be on the stack.
</p><p>
- A triggered ability that changes the rules of the game: The controller
 must acknowledge the trigger or prevent an opponent from taking any 
resulting illegal action.
</p><p>
- A triggered ability that affects the game state in non-visible ways: 
The controller must make the change known by the first time the change 
has an effect on the visible game state.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Once any of the above obligations has been fulfilled, further problems are treated as a Game Play Error - Game Rule Violation.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Triggered abilities that do nothing except create delayed triggered 
abilities automatically resolve without requiring acknowledgment. 
Awareness of the resulting delayed trigger must be demonstrated at the 
appropriate point. Triggered abilities that do nothing except create one
 or more copies of a spell or ability (such as storm or cipher) 
automatically resolve, but awareness of the resulting objects must be 
demonstrated using the same requirements as described above (even though
 the objects may not be triggered abilities).
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
If a triggered ability would have no impact on the game, it's not an 
infraction to fail to demonstrate awareness of it. For example, if the 
effect of a triggered ability instructs its controller to sacrifice a 
creature, a player who controls no creatures isn't required to 
demonstrate awareness of the ability. Similarly, a player demonstrating 
awareness of an optional trigger with no visible effect is assumed to 
have made the affirmative choice unless the opponent responds.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Judges do not intervene in a missed trigger situation unless they intend
 to issue a Warning or have reason to suspect that the controller is 
intentionally missing his or her triggered abilities.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
A player controlling another player is responsible for that player's triggers in addition to his or her own.
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>Examples</b></h4>
<p>
A. Knight of Infamy (a 2/1 creature with exalted) attacks alone. Its controller says Take two.<br>
</p><p>
B. A player forgets to remove the final time counter from a suspended spell and then draws a card during his draw step.<br>
</p><p>
C. A player casts Manic Vandal, then forgets its triggered ability by 
not choosing a target for it. He realizes this only after casting 
another spell.<br>
</p><p>
D. A player forgets to exile the Angel token created by Geist of Saint Traft at end of combat.<br>
</p><p>
She realizes the error when declaring blockers during the next turn.
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>Philosophy</b></h4>
<p>
Triggered abilities are common and invisible, so players should not be 
harshly penalized when forgetting about one. Players are expected to 
remember their own triggered abilities; intentionally ignoring one may 
be Unsporting Conduct - Cheating (unless the ability would have no 
impact on the game as described above). Even if an opponent is involved 
in the announcement or resolution of the ability, the controller is 
still responsible for ensuring the opponents make the appropriate 
choices and take the appropriate actions. Opponents are not required to 
point out triggered abilities that they do not control, though they may 
do so if they wish.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Triggered abilities are assumed to be remembered until otherwise 
indicated, and the impact on the game state may not be immediately 
apparent. The opponent's benefit is in not having to point out triggered
 abilities, although this does not mean that they can cause triggers to 
be missed. If an opponent requires information about the precise timing 
of a triggered ability or needs details about a game object that may be 
affected by a resolved triggered ability, that player may need to 
acknowledge that ability's existence before its controller does. A 
player who makes a play that may or may not be legal depending on 
whether an uncommunicated trigger has been remembered has not committed 
an infraction; their play either succeeds, confirming that the trigger 
has been missed, or is rewound.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Players may not cause triggered abilities controlled by an opponent to 
be missed by taking game actions or otherwise prematurely advancing the 
game. During an opponent's turn, if a trigger's controller demonstrates 
awareness of the trigger before they take an active role (such as taking
 an action or explicitly passing priority), the trigger is remembered. 
The Out-of-Order Sequencing rules (MTR section 4.3) may also be 
applicable, especially as they relate to batches of actions or resolving
 items on the stack in an improper order.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>Additional Remedy</b></h4>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Three types of triggered abilities do not expire and resolve immediately if they are discovered:
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
- A triggered ability that specifies a default action associated with a 
choice made by the controller (usually "If you don't ..." or "... 
unless"). The opponent may choose not to resolve this trigger. Otherwise
 the default action must be chosen.
</p><p>
- An enters-the-battlefield trigger of an Aura that affects only the 
enchanted permanent and causes a visible change to that permanent.
</p><p>
- A delayed triggered ability that changes the zone of one or more 
objects defined when the ability was created. For this trigger, the 
opponent chooses whether to resolve the ability the next time a player 
would get priority or when a player would get priority at the start of 
the next phase.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
If the ability was missed prior to the current phase in the previous 
turn, instruct the players to continue playing. If the triggered ability
 created an effect whose duration has already expired, instruct the 
players to continue playing.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
If the triggered ability isn't covered by the previous two paragraphs, 
the opponent chooses whether the triggered ability is added to the 
stack. If it is, it's inserted at the appropriate place on the stack if 
possible or on the bottom of the stack. No player may make choices 
involving objects that would not have been legal choices when the 
ability should have triggered. For example, if the ability instructs a 
player to sacrifice a creature, that player can't sacrifice a creature 
that wasn't on the battlefield when the ability should have triggered.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Upgrade: If the triggered ability is usually considered detrimental for 
the controlling player the penalty is a Warning. The current game state 
is not a factor in determining this, though symmetrical abilities (such 
as Howling Mine) may be considered usually detrimental or not depending 
on who is being affected

<table border="1">
<tbody><tr>
<th colspan="1">Penalty</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Warning</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>
</p><h4><b>Definition</b></h4>
<p>
A player takes an action that may have enabled them to see the faces of cards in a deck that they were not entitled to see.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
This penalty is applied only once if one or more cards are seen in the same action or sequence of actions.
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>Examples</b></h4>
<p>
A. A player accidentally reveals (drops, flips over) a card while shuffling her opponent's library.<br>
</p><p>
B. A player pulls up an extra card while drawing from his library.<br>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
C. A player sees the bottom card of her deck when presenting it to her opponent for cutting/shuffling.<br>
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>Philosophy</b></h4>
<p>
A player can accidentally look at extra cards easily and this infraction
 handles situations where a dexterity or rules error has led to a player
 seeing cards in a library that they shouldn't have.
</p><p>
Cards are considered to be in a library until they touch cards in 
another hidden set. Once those cards have joined another hidden set, the
 infraction is handled as a Hidden Card Error or Game Rule Violation.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Players should not use this penalty to get a free shuffle or to attempt 
to shuffle away cards they don't want to draw; doing so may be 
Unsporting Conduct - Cheating. Players also are not allowed to use this 
penalty as a stalling mechanism. The library is already randomized, so 
shuffling in the revealed cards should not involve excessive effort.
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>Additional Remedy</b></h4>
<p>
Shuffle any previously unknown cards into the random portion of the 
deck, then put any known cards back in their correct locations.

<table border="1">
<tbody><tr>
<th colspan="1">Penalty</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Warning</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>
</p><h4><b>Definition</b></h4>
<p>
A player commits an error in the game that cannot be corrected by only 
publicly available information and does so without his or her opponent's
 permission.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
This infraction only applies when a card whose identity is known to only
 one player is in a hidden set of cards both before and after the error.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
This infraction does not apply to simple dexterity errors, such as when a
 card being pulled off the library sticks to another card and is seen or
 knocked off the library. The cards themselves must be part of a 
distinct set intended by the player.
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>Examples</b></h4>
<p>
A. A player draws four cards after casting Ancestral Recall.<br>
</p><p>
B. A player scries two cards when he should only have scried one.<br>
</p><p>
C. A player resolves a Dark Confidant trigger, but forgets to reveal the card before putting it into her hand.<br>
</p><p>
D. A player has more cards in his hand than can be accounted for.<br>
</p><p>
E. A player casts Anticipate and picks up the top four cards of her library.<br>
</p><p>
F. A player, going first, draws for his turn.<br>
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>Philosophy</b></h4>
<p>
Though the game state cannot be reversed to the correct' state, this 
error can be mitigated by giving the opponent sufficient knowledge and 
ability to offset the error so that it is less likely to generate 
advantage.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
If cards are placed into a public zone, then their order is known and 
the infraction can be handled as a Game Rule Violation. Order cannot be 
determined from card faces only visible to one player unless the card is
 in a uniquely identifiable position (such as on top of the library, or 
as the only card in hand.)
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Be careful not to apply this infraction in situations where a 
publicly-correctable error subsequently leads to an uncorrectable 
situation such as a Brainstorm cast using green mana. In these 
situations, the infraction is based on that root cause.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Information about cards previously known by the opponent, such as cards 
previously revealed while on the top of the library or by a previous 
look at the hand, may be taken into account while determining the set of
 cards to which the remedy applies.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Always operate on the smallest set possible to remedy the error. This 
may mean applying the remedy to only part of a set defined by an 
instruction. For example, if a player resolves Collected Company, picks 
up three cards with one hand and then four cards with the other, the 
last drawn set of four cards should be used for the remedy, instead of 
the full set of seven cards..
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>Additional Remedy</b></h4>
<p>
In cases where the infraction was immediately followed by moving a card 
from the affected set to a known location, such as by discarding, 
putting cards on top of the library, or playing a land, a simple backup 
to the point just after the error may be performed.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
If the set of cards that contained the problem no longer exists, there is no remedy to be applied.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
If the error put cards into a set prematurely and other operations 
involving cards in the set should have been performed first, the player 
reveals the set of cards that contains the excess and his or her 
opponent chooses a number of previously-unknown cards. Put those cards 
aside until the point at which they should have been legally added, then
 return them to the set.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
If the error involves one or more cards that were supposed to be 
revealed, the player reveals the set of cards that contains the 
unrevealed cards and his or her opponent chooses that many 
previously-unknown cards. Treat those as the cards that were revealed' 
and return them to the set that was being selected from; the player then
 reperforms the action. If recreating the original selection set and 
reperforming the action would be too disruptive, leave the selected 
cards in hand.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
If a set affected by the error contains more cards than it is supposed 
to contain, the player reveals the set of cards that contains the excess
 and his or her opponent chooses a number of previously-unknown cards 
sufficient to reduce the set to the correct size. These excess cards are
 returned to the correct location. If that location is the library, they
 should be shuffled into the random portion unless the owner previously 
knew the identity of the card/cards illegally moved; that many cards, 
chosen by the opponent, are returned to the top of the library instead. 
For example, if a player playing with Sphinx of Jwar Isle illegally 
draws a card, that card should be returned to the top of the library.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Upgrade: If a face-down card cast using a morph ability is discovered 
during the game to not have a morph ability, the penalty is a Game Loss.
 If the player has one or more cards with a 11
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
morph ability in hand, has not added cards to his or her hand since 
casting the card found in violation, and has discovered the error 
themselves, the upgrade does not apply and they may swap the card for a 
card with the morph ability in hand.

<table border="1">
<tbody><tr>
<th colspan="1">Penalty</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Warning</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>
</p><h4><b>Definition</b></h4>
<p>
A player makes an error during the mulligan process. This infraction 
does not apply to errors made once pre-game procedures are complete. 
Scrying for more than one card after taking a mulligan is treated as a 
Hidden Card Error.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Trivial process errors that provide no advantage, such as declaring an intent to mulligan early, are not an infraction.
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>Examples</b></h4>
<p>
A. A player draws eight cards at the start of the game (instead of seven).<br>
</p><p>
B. A player draws seven cards at the start of the game (instead of six) after taking a mulligan.<br>
</p><p>
C. A player keeps her hand, scries, then mulligans again.<br>
</p><p>
D. A player chooses to not take a mulligan then takes a mulligan after seeing his opponent choose to take a mulligan.<br>
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>Philosophy</b></h4>
<p>
Errors prior to the beginning of the game have a less disruptive 
option-a forced mulligan-that is not available at any other point during
 the game. However, players should not be incentivized to sit on the 
infraction until mulligan procedures are completed so that they can 
discover' the error at a point where it becomes a Hidden Card Error if 
they believe that is to their advantage.
</p><p>
To encourage the offending player to report their error as early as 
possible, they are given their choice of remedy before the game begins.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
If a player looks at the top card of his or her library after taking a 
mulligan, it is assumed that they have chosen to keep their hand unless 
they make it very clear that they intend to mulligan again, either 
verbally before looking or by picking up multiple cards from the top of 
their library.
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>Additional Remedy</b></h4>
<p>
If the player has too many cards in hand, he or she may choose to reveal
 his or her hand, and his or her opponent chooses a card from it to be 
shuffled back into the library. If more than one excess card was drawn 
(for example, eight cards drawn during a mulligan to 6) his or her 
opponent continues removing cards until the correct number has been 
reached.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
If cards are not removed from the hand this way (either due to an error 
that didn't lead to too many cards, or by the player choosing not to 
reveal), that player takes an additional mulligan.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Players may continue taking mulligans after the remedy has been completed.
</p><p>

<table border="1">
<tbody><tr>
<th colspan="1">Penalty</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Warning</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>
</p><h4><b>Definition</b></h4>
<p>
This infraction covers the majority of game situations in which a player
 makes an error or fails to follow a game procedure correctly. It 
handles violations of the Comprehensive Rules that are not covered by 
the other Game Play Errors.
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>Examples</b></h4>
<p>
A. A player casts Wrath of God for 3W (actual cost 2WW).<br>
</p><p>
B. A player does not attack with a creature that must attack each turn.<br>
</p><p>
C. A player fails to put a creature with lethal damage into a graveyard and it is not noticed until several turns later.<br>
</p><p>
D. A Phyrexian Revoker is on the battlefield that should have had a card named for it.<br>
</p><p>
E. A player casts Brainstorm and forgets to put two cards back on top of his library.<br>
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>Philosophy</b></h4>
<p>
While Game Rule Violations can be attributed to one player, they usually
 occur publicly and both players are expected to be mindful of what is 
happening in the game. It is tempting to try and fix these errors, but 
it is important that they be handled consistently, regardless of their 
impact on the game.
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>Additional Remedy</b></h4>
<p>
If the infraction falls into one of the following categories, and only 
into that category, perform the fix specified unless a simple backup is 
possible:
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
- If a player made an illegal choice (including no choice where 
required) for a static ability generating a continuous effect still on 
the battlefield, that player makes a legal choice.
</p><p>
- If a player forgot to draw cards, discard cards, or return cards from their hand to another zone, that player does so.
</p><p>
- If an object is in an incorrect zone either due to a required zone 
change being missed or due to being put into the wrong zone during a 
zone change, the identity of the object was known to all players, and it
 can be moved with only minor disruption to the current state of the 
game, put the object in the correct zone.
</p><p>
- If damage assignment order has not been declared, the appropriate player chooses that order.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
For each of these fixes, a simple backup may be performed beforehand if it makes applying the fix smoother.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Otherwise, a backup may be considered or the game state may be left as is.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
For most Game Play Errors not caught within a time that a player could 
reasonably be expected to notice, opponents receive a Game Play Error - 
Failure to Maintain Game State penalty. If the judge believes that both 
players were responsible for a Game Rule Violation, such as due to the 
existence of replacement effects or a player taking action based on 
another players instruction, both players receive a Game Play Error - 
Game Rule Violation. For example, if a player casts Path to Exile on an 
opponent's creature and the opponent puts the creature into the 
graveyard, both players have committed this infraction.

</tbody></table>
<p>
</p><h4><b>Definition</b></h4>
<p>
A player allows another player in the game to commit a Game Play Error 
and does not point it out immediately. If a judge believes a player is 
intentionally not pointing out other players'
</p><p>
illegal actions, either for his or her own advantage, or in the hope of 
bringing it up at a more strategically advantageous time, they should 
consider an Unsporting Conduct - Cheating infraction. Not reminding an 
opponent about his or her triggered abilities is never Failure to 
Maintain Game State nor Cheating.
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>Examples</b></h4>
<p>
A. A player's opponent forgets to reveal the card searched for by Worldly Tutor. It is not noticed until the end of turn.<br>
</p><p>
B. A player does not notice that his opponent has Armadillo Cloak on a creature with protection from green.<br>
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>Philosophy</b></h4>
<p>
If an error is caught before a player could gain advantage, then the 
dangers of the ongoing game state becoming corrupted are much lower. If 
the error is allowed to persist, at least some of the fault lies with 
the opponent, who has also failed to notice the error.
</p><p>
</p><p>

</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
<a name="3"></a></p><h4>3 TOURNAMENT ERRORS</h4>
<p>
Tournament errors are violations of the Magic Tournament Rules. If the 
judge believes that the error was intentional, he or she should consider
 Unsporting Conduct - Cheating. (Previous versions of the MIPG made 
reference in each section about how to handle an intentional violation; 
with the exception of Slow Play, all intentional violations are now 
evaluated as potential Unsporting Conduct - Cheating.)
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
If a player violates the Magic Tournament Rules in a way that is not 
covered by one of the infractions listed below, the judge should explain
 the appropriate procedure to the player, but not issue a penalty. 
Continued or willful disregard of these rules may require further 
investigation.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
A second or subsequent Warning for a Tournament Error offense in the 
same category is upgraded to a Game Loss. For multi-day tournaments, the
 penalty count for these infractions resets between days.

</tbody></table>
<p>
</p><h4><b>Definition</b></h4>
<p>
A player is not in his or her seat at the beginning of a round, or has 
not completed tasks assigned within the time allocated. If a round 
begins before the previous round would have ended (due to all players 
finishing early), tardiness does not apply until the scheduled end of 
the previous round.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
If, before or during a match, a player requests permission from a judge 
for a delay for a legitimate task, such as a bathroom break or finding 
replacements for missing cards, that player may have up to 10 minutes to
 perform that task before he or she is considered tardy. If the player 
takes more than 10 minutes, a Match Loss will be applied. Otherwise, no 
penalty will be applied and a time extension given for the time taken.
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>Examples</b></h4>
<p>
A. A player arrives to her seat 5 minutes after the round begins.<br>
</p><p>
B. A player hands in his decklist after the time designated by the judge or organizer.<br>
</p><p>
C. A player loses her deck and cannot find replacement cards within the first 10 minutes of the round.<br>
</p><p>
D. A player sits at an incorrect table and plays the wrong opponent.<br>
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>Philosophy</b></h4>
<p>
Players are responsible for being on time and in the correct seat for 
their matches, and for completing registrations in a timely manner. The 
Tournament Organizer may announce that they are giving the players some 
additional time before a penalty is issued. Otherwise, the penalty is 
issued as soon as the round begins.
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>Additional Remedy</b></h4>
<p>
The players are given a time extension corresponding to the length of the tardiness.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Upgrade: A player not in his or her seat 10 minutes into the round will 
receive a Match Loss and will be dropped from the tournament unless he 
or she reports to the Head Judge or Scorekeeper before the end of the 
round.

<p>
</p><h4><b>Definition</b></h4>
<p>
A player, spectator, or other tournament participant does any of the following:
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
- Seeks play advice or hidden information about his or her match from others once he or she has sat for his or her match.
</p><p>
- Gives play advice or reveals hidden information to players who have sat for their match.
</p><p>
- During a game, refers to notes (other than Oracle- pages) made before the official beginning of the current match.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
These criteria also apply to any deck construction and draft portions of a limited tournament.
</p><p>
Additionally, no notes of any kind may be made during a draft. Some team
 formats have additional communication rules that may modify the 
definition of this infraction.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Notes made outside the current match may only be referenced between 
games, and must have been in the player's possession since the beginning
 of the match.
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>Examples</b></h4>
<p>
A. During a game, a player references play notes that were created before the tournament.<br>
</p><p>
B. A spectator points out the correct play to a player who had not solicited the information.<br>
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>Philosophy</b></h4>
<p>
Tournaments test the skill of a player, not his or her ability to follow
 external advice or directions. Any strategy advice, play advice, or 
construction advice from an external source is considered outside 
assistance.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Visual modifications to cards, including brief text, that provide minor 
strategic information or hints are acceptable and not considered notes. 
Detailed instructions or complex strategic advice may not be written on 
cards. The Head Judge is the final arbiter on what cards and notes are 
acceptable for a tournament. Spectators who commit this infraction may 
be asked to leave the venue if they are not enrolled in the tournament.

<td>Warning</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>
</p><h4><b>Definition</b></h4>
<p>
A player takes longer than is reasonably required to complete game 
actions. If a judge believes a player is intentionally playing slowly to
 take advantage of a time limit, the infraction is Unsporting Conduct - 
Stalling.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
It is also slow play if a player continues to execute a loop without 
being able to provide an exact number of iterations and the expected 
resulting game state.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>Examples</b></h4>
<p>
A. A player repeatedly reviews his opponent's graveyard without any significant change in game state.<br>
</p><p>
B. A player spends time writing down the contents of an opponent's library while resolving Thought Hemorrhage.<br>
</p><p>
C. A player takes an excessive amount of time to shuffle his deck between games.<br>
</p><p>
D. A player gets up from his seat to look at standings or goes to the bathroom without permission of an official.<br>
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>Philosophy</b></h4>
<p>
All players have the responsibility to play quickly enough so that their
 opponents are not at a significant disadvantage because of the time 
limit. A player may be playing slowly without realizing it. A comment of
 I need you to play faster is often appropriate and all that is needed.
</p><p>
Further slow play should be penalized.
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>Additional Remedy</b></h4>
<p>
In the event that the match exceeds the time limit, two additional turns
 are added to the number of additional turns played. This turn extension
 occurs before any end-of-match procedure can begin and after any time 
extensions that may have been issued.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
No additional turns are awarded if the match is already in additional turns, though the Warning still applies.

<p>
</p><h4><b>Definition</b></h4>
<p>
The decklist is illegal, doesn't match what the player intended to play,
 or needs to be modified due to card loss over the course of the 
tournament.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
This infraction does not cover errors in registration made by another 
participant prior to a sealed pool swap. Those should be corrected at 
the discretion of the judge.
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>Examples</b></h4>
<p>
A. A player in a Legacy tournament lists Mana Drain (a banned card) on his decklist.<br>
</p><p>
B. A player has a 56-card decklist. Her actual deck contains 60 cards, with four Dispels not listed.<br>
</p><p>
C. A player lists Sarkhan' in a format with both Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker and Sarkhan Unbroken.<br>
</p><p>
D. A player loses some cards and is unable to find replacement copies, 
making her unable to play a deck that matches her decklist.<br>
</p><p>
E. A player registers Ajani, Valiant Protector, but she is playing Ajani Unyielding.<br>
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>Philosophy</b></h4>
<p>
Decklists are used to ensure that decks are not altered in the course of
 a tournament. Judges and other tournament officials should be vigilant 
about reminding players before the tournament begins of the importance 
of submitting a legal decklist, and playing with a legal deck. A player 
normally receives a Game Loss if his or her decklist is altered after 
tournament play has begun.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Penalties for decklist errors discovered during a deckcheck are issued 
immediately. Other decklist penalties are issued at the start of the 
next round to minimize the disruption to the match currently being 
played and provide consistency in case some players have finished 
playing their match before the penalty can be administered.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Ambiguous or unclear names on a decklist may allow a player to 
manipulate the contents of his or her deck up until the point at which 
they are discovered. Truncated names of storyline characters on 
decklists (legendary permanents and planeswalkers) are acceptable as 
long as they are the only representation of that character in the format
 and are treated as referring to that card, even if other cards begin 
with the same name.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
The Head Judge may choose to not issue this penalty if they believe that
 what the player wrote on their decklist is obvious and unambiguous, 
even if it is not the full, accurate name of the card.
</p><p>
In Limited tournaments, the Head Judge may choose not to issue this 
penalty for incorrectly marked basic land counts if they believe the 
correct land count is obvious. This should be determined solely by what 
is written on the decklist, and not based on intent or the actual 
contents of the deck; needing to check the deck for confirmation is a 
sign that the entry is not obvious.
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>Additional Remedy</b></h4>
<p>
If the decklist contains illegal cards, remove them.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Alter the decklist to match the deck the player is actually playing. If 
the deck/sideboard and decklist both violate a maximum cards restriction
 (usually too many cards in a sideboard or more than four of a card), 
remove cards starting from the bottom of the appropriate section of the 
list.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
If the deck contains too few cards, the player chooses to add any 
combination of cards named Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain or Forest to 
reach the minimum number. Alter the decklist to reflect this. These 
changes may be reverted without penalty if the player is subsequently 
able to locate identical replacements to legal original cards.

<p>
</p><h4><b>Definition</b></h4>
<p>
The contents of a deck or sideboard do not match the decklist registered
 and the decklist represents what the player intended to play.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
If there are extra cards stored with the sideboard that could 
conceivably be played in the player's deck, they will be considered a 
part of the sideboard unless they are:
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
- Promotional cards that have been handed out as part of the tournament.
</p><p>
- Double-faced cards represented by checklist cards in the deck.
</p><p>
- Double-faced cards being used to represent the back side of cards in 
the deck. These cards must not be sleeved in the same way as cards in 
the main deck and/or sideboard.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Cards in different sleeves, tokens, and double-faced cards for which 
checklists are being used are ignored when determining deck (not 
sideboard) legality.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
If a player is unable to locate cards (or identical equivalents) from 
their main deck, treat it as a Decklist Problem. If sideboard cards are 
missing, make a note of this, but issue no penalty.
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>Examples</b></h4>
<p>
A. A player has 59 cards in her deck, but 60 listed on her decklist.<br>
</p><p>
B. A player has a Pacifism in his deck from a previous opponent.<br>
</p><p>
C. In game one of a match, A player has Pithing Needle in her deck, but only has one registered in her sideboard.<br>
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>Philosophy</b></h4>
<p>
Players are expected to call attention to deck errors immediately, and 
not gain any potential advantage from having the cards in their deck.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
The most common forms of deck error are failure to desideboard and 
having a card in the wrong deck. Both of these are difficult to gain 
advantage from without obvious cheating. Denying them the card that they
 would otherwise be working with is sufficient to compensate for the 
easily discovered situations. Duplicates of cards that begin in the main
 deck are more problematic, as they are not as easy to realize and 
catch, and thus mandate an upgraded penalty.
</p><p>
A window in which the error is a Game Loss is necessary to discourage 
intentional abuse. Once that point has passed, the opponent agrees that 
the deck is valid. Judges should always be mindful of the abuse 
possibilities when investigating these infractions.
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>Additional Remedy</b></h4>
<p>
Remove any incorrect cards from the deck, including any sideboard cards 
that could not yet legally have been added. Locate any cards missing 
from the deck and shuffle them into the deck.
</p><p>
If the missing card(s) are with the sideboard and it isn't the first 
game, choose the ones to be shuffled into the deck at random from all 
sideboard cards. If the error is discovered during opening hands, 
instruct the player to mulligan. Otherwise, do not replace discovered 
erroneous cards in hands or other sets (such as a group of cards being 
scried or drawn).
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
If the missing card(s) were in a previous or current opponent's deck, issue Warnings to both players.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Upgrade: If the deck is discovered to be incorrect during the 
presentation period, and the missing cards are not in the opponent's 
deck, the penalty is a Game Loss.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Upgrade: If an incorrect card becomes or is about to become visible to 
an opponent (for example due to it being revealed or put into a 
graveyard) or is discovered by a judge, the penalty is a Game Loss.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Upgrade: If an error resulted in more copies of a main deck card being 
played than were registered and this was discovered after the game had 
begun, the penalty is a Game Loss. For example if the decklist has two 
copies of Shock in the main deck and two in the sideboard, but there are
 three copies of Shock in the library, the penalty is upgraded.

<table border="1">

<th colspan="1">Penalty</th>

<tr>
<td>Warning</td>

</tbody></table>
<p>
</p><h4><b>Definition</b></h4>
<p>
A player violates the Player Communication policy detailed in section 
4.1 of the Magic Tournament Rules. This infraction only applies to 
violations of that policy and not to general communication confusion.
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>Examples</b></h4>
<p>
A. A player is asked how many cards he has in his hand and answers Three. A few moments later, he realizes that he has four.<br>
</p><p>
B. A player claims she hasn't played her land for the turn, but it is determined that she had and forgot.<br>
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>Philosophy</b></h4>
<p>
Clear communication is essential when playing Magic. Though many 
offenses will be intentional, it is possible for a player to make a 
genuine mistake and these should not be penalized harshly. Refer to 
section 4.1 of the Magic Tournament Rules for a full explanation of the 
policy. It can be summarized as:
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
- Players must answer all questions asked of them by a judge completely 
and honestly, regardless of the type of information requested. Players 
may request to do so away from the match.
</p><p>
- Players may not represent derived or free information incorrectly.
</p><p>
- Players must answer completely and honestly any specific questions pertaining to free information.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>Additional Remedy</b></h4>
<p>
A backup may be considered in cases where a player has clearly acted 
upon incorrect information provided to him or her by his or her 
opponent. The backup should be to the point of the action, not the 
erroneous communication.

<th colspan="1">Penalty</th>

</tbody></table>
<p>
</p><h4><b>Definition</b></h4>
<p>
Cards or sleeves in a player's deck have inconsistencies on them that 
might allow them to be differentiated from each other while in the 
library. This includes scuff marks, nail marks, discoloration, bent 
corners and curving from foils.
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>Examples</b></h4>
<p>
A. A player has small marks on a few of his sleeves. The markings are on a Mountain, a Loxodon Hierarch, and a Lightning Helix.<br>
</p><p>
B. A player without sleeves has several foil cards that stand out significantly from the rest of her deck.<br>
</p><p>
C. The basic lands in a player's unsleeved deck are from a set with notably lighter backs.<br>
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>Philosophy</b></h4>
<p>
Sleeves and cards often become worn over the course of a tournament, 
and, as long as the player is not attempting to take advantage of this, 
addressing the situation is sufficient in most cases.
</p><p>
Note that almost all sleeves can be considered marked in some way; 
judges should keep this in mind when determining penalties. In cases of 
marked cards, educating players to shuffle their cards and sleeves 
before sleeving the cards is very important.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
This infraction applies only to cards in a player's deck. 
Differently-marked sleeves in the sideboard are not illegal unless they 
are put into the deck without being changed. Unless investigating, 
judges are encouraged to alert players about concerns with marked 
sideboard cards.
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>Additional Remedy</b></h4>
<p>
The player needs to replace the card(s) or sleeve(s) with an unmarked 
version or, if no sleeves are being used, use sleeves that conceal the 
markings. If the cards themselves have become marked through play in the
 tournament, the Head Judge may decide to issue a proxy. If the player 
is unable to find replacement cards, he or she may replace those cards 
with basic lands; this change may be reverted at a later point if 
replacements for marked cards are found.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Upgrade: If the Head Judge believes that a deck's owner noticing the 
pattern of markings would be able to gain substantial advantage from 
this knowledge, the penalty is a Game Loss.

<table border="1">
<tbody><tr>
<th colspan="1">Penalty</th>

<tr>
<td>Warning</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>
</p><h4><b>Definition</b></h4>
<p>
A player unintentionally fails to sufficiently shuffle his or her deck 
or portion of his or her deck before presenting it to his or her 
opponent or fails to present it to his or her opponent for further 
randomization. A deck is not shuffled if the judge believes a player 
could know the position or distribution of one or more cards in his or 
her deck.
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>Examples</b></h4>
<p>
A. A player forgets to shuffle his library after searching for a card.<br>
</p><p>
B. A player searches for a card, then gives the library a single riffle-shuffle before presenting the library to her opponent.<br>
</p><p>
C. A player fails to shuffle the portion of his library revealed during the resolution of a cascade ability.<br>
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>Philosophy</b></h4>
<p>
Players are expected to shuffle their deck thoroughly when it is 
required and are expected to have the skill and understanding of 
randomization to do so. However, as the opponent has the opportunity to 
shuffle after the player does, the potential for advantage is lowered if
 tournament policy is followed.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Any time cards in a deck could be seen, including during shuffling, it 
is no longer shuffled, even if the player only knows the position of one
 or two cards. Players are expected to take care in shuffling not to 
reveal cards to themselves, their teammates, or their opponents.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
A player should shuffle his or her deck using multiple methods. 
Patterned pile-shuffling is only allowed at the start of a game. Any 
manipulation, weaving, or stacking prior to randomization is acceptable,
 as long as the deck is thoroughly shuffled afterwards.
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>Additional Remedy</b></h4>
<p>
Shuffle the random portion of the deck thoroughly.

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Unsporting behavior is not the same as a lack of sporting behavior. 
There is a wide middle ground of competitive behavior that is certainly 
neither nice nor sporting but still doesn't qualify as unsporting. The 
Head Judge is the final arbiter on what constitutes unsporting conduct.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Judges should inform the player how his or her conduct is disruptive. 
The player is expected to correct the situation and behavior 
immediately. However, while making sure that the player understands the 
severity of his or her actions is important, judges should focus first 
on calming a situation, and deal with infractions and penalties 
afterwards.

<p>
</p><h4><b>Definition</b></h4>
<p>
A player takes action that is disruptive to the tournament or its 
participants. It may affect the comfort level of those around the 
individual, but determining whether this is the case is not required.
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>Examples</b></h4>
<p>
A. A player uses excessively vulgar and profane language.<br>
</p><p>
B. A player inappropriately demands to a judge that her opponent receive a penalty.<br>
</p><p>
C. A player appeals to the Head Judge before waiting for the floor judge to issue a ruling.<br>
</p><p>
D. A player throws his deck on the ground after losing a game.<br>
</p><p>
E. A player leaves excessive trash in the play area after leaving the table.<br>
</p><p>
F. A player fails to follow the request of a tournament official to leave the play area.<br>
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>Philosophy</b></h4>
<p>
All participants should expect a safe and enjoyable environment at a 
tournament, and a player needs to be made aware if his or her behavior 
is unacceptable so that this environment may be maintained.
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>Additional Remedy</b></h4>
<p>
The player must correct the problem immediately. Subsequent Unsporting 
Conduct - Minor infractions, even for different offenses, will result in
 a Game Loss. If a Game Loss is issued for repeated infractions, and it 
occurs at the end of a game, it is acceptable for the judge to apply the
 penalty to the next game instead.

<p>
</p><h4><b>Definition</b></h4>
<p>
A player takes action towards one or more individuals that could 
reasonably be expected to create a feeling of being harassed, 
threatened, bullied, or stalked. This may include insults based on race,
 color, religion, national origin, age, gender, disability, or sexual 
orientation. Threats of physical violence should be treated as 
Unsporting Conduct  Aggressive Behavior.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
It is possible for an offender to commit this infraction without intending malice or harm to the subject of the harassment.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>Examples</b></h4>
<p>
A. A player uses a racial slur against his opponent.<br>
</p><p>
B. A player takes inappropriate photos of another player without express permission.<br>
</p><p>
C. A player asks a spectator for a date, is denied, and continues to press the issue.<br>
</p><p>
D. A player purposefully obstructs another player with the intent of inducing physical contact.<br>
</p><p>
E. A spectator uses social media to bully another player.<br>
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>Philosophy</b></h4>
<p>
A safe environment is a basic expectation of any tournament attendee. 
Harassment undermines the safety and integrity of a tournament. Players 
who purposefully create harmful or unwelcoming situations in a 
tournament are expected to immediately correct the behavior and 
demonstrate remorse or be removed.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Because of the confrontational nature of this infraction, judges need to
 end any match in progress and separate the players. Care should be 
taken not to escalate the situation if at all possible. The offender 
will be removed from the area to receive the penalty, and education 
about why the behavior is unacceptable regardless of excuse. They may 
need a few moments to cool down afterwards. Apologizing is encouraged, 
but the desire of the other individuals to not interact with their 
harasser must be respected.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Officials must investigate these matters as soon as they are brought to 
their attention. If they determine that the infraction does not meet the
 criteria for Unsporting Conduct  Major, it is still recommended that 
the players be talked to to avoid future misunderstandings.
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>Additional Remedy</b></h4>
<p>
The player must correct the behavior immediately. If the offense occurs 
at the end of a match, it is acceptable for the judge to apply the 
penalty to the next match instead.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Upgrade: If the offense was committed with malicious intent, the player 
displays no remorse, or the offense is repeated at a later time, the 
penalty is Disqualification and removal from the venue.

Wagering occurs when a player or spectator at a tournament places or

</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Additionally, the offense must meet the following criteria for it to be considered Cheating:
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
- The player must be attempting to gain advantage from his or her action.
</p><p>
- The player must be aware that he or she is doing something illegal.

   <em>Effective May 3, 2019<br> Last updated June 6, 2019</em>
  </div> 
  <h2>Introduction</h2> 
  <div> 
   <p><span>The DCI is a worldwide organization dedicated to organized play. It promotes, enforces, and develops rules and policies using the goals and philosophies defined in this document,</span> (the Magic Tournament Rules, or the MTR), the <strong>Magic: The Gathering</strong> Infraction Procedure Guide, and the Judging at Regular Rules Enforcement Level document. It constantly reviews these rules and policies to ensure its goals are met.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div></div> 
  <br> 
  <p>There are two types of sanctioned <strong>Magic</strong> tournaments: rated and casual. Rated tournaments offer Planeswalker Points for each win, draw, or bye a player earns. Casual tournaments offer a single Planeswalker Point for participation.</p> 
  <p>The purpose of this document is to provide the infrastructure used to run <strong>Magic: The Gathering</strong> ("<strong>Magic</strong>") tournaments by defining appropriate rules, responsibilities, and procedures to be followed in all DCI-sanctioned, competitive-level <strong>Magic</strong> tournaments. DCI-sanctioned tournaments are to be run consistently regardless of their location. This ensures equal treatment of players in different regions and also enables their smooth transition to international tournaments. All players are treated equally and share responsibilities according to the Rules Enforcement Level (REL) of the tournament. Both players and officials should cooperate to achieve their common goal of running a proper DCI-sanctioned tournament. Players and officials must treat each other in a fair and respectful manner, following both the rules and the spirit in which those rules were created. They are responsible for following the most current version of the <strong>Magic</strong> Tournament Rules (MTR) and <strong>Magic: The Gathering</strong> Comprehensive Rules. Spectators have their own set of responsibilities. Individuals violating DCI rules are subject to penalties defined by the appropriate document for the tournament's Rules Enforcement Level.</p> 
  <p>Information in this document may contradict (or have information not contained in) the Comprehensive Rules. In such cases, this document takes precedence.</p> 
  <p>Official tournament fact sheets located on the Wizards of the Coast website for specific tournaments may define alternative or additional policies or procedures. If a contradiction exists between this document and an official fact sheet located on the Wizards of the Coast website, the information in the fact sheet takes precedence.</p> 
  <p>Wizards of the Coast reserves the right to alter these rules, as well as the right to interpret, modify, clarify, or otherwise issue official changes to these rules without prior notice.</p> 
  <p>2019 updates to this document are scheduled to be announced the Monday after each Prerelease. There may be additional dates in which updates to this document will be announced. The dates of any additional announcements will be communicated with at least 4 weeks' notice. Other updates not involving updates to card legality may<br> occur without prior announcement.</p>

  <h1 class="entry-title">MTR 1.1 Tournament Types</h1> 
 </header>
 <div class="entry-content"> 
  <p>Sanctioned, rated tournaments are divided into two types: Premier and non-Premier. Premier tournaments are run by Wizards of the Coast or select Tournament Organizers. They have unique names and features. Non-Premier tournaments are tournaments that are not explicitly Premier.</p>  
  <p>There are two major tournament formats: Limited and Constructed. Each has rules specific to its format. In Limited tournaments, all product for play is provided during the tournament. In Constructed tournaments, players compete using decks prepared beforehand. Some Premier tournaments may consist of multiple formats within the same tournament.</p>  
 </div>
 <header class="entry-header" id="mtr1-2"> 
  <h1 class="entry-title">MTR 1.2 Publishing Tournament Information</h1> 
 </header>
 <div class="entry-content"> 
  <p>Wizards of the Coast reserves the right to publish DCI-sanctioned tournament information at any time (including during the tournament). Tournament information includes, but is not limited to, the contents of one or more players' decks, descriptions of strategies or play, transcripts, and video reproductions. Tournament Organizers are also allowed to publish this information once their tournament is complete.</p>  
  <p>Wizards of the Coast reserves the right to publish penalty and suspension information.</p>  
 </div>
 <header class="entry-header" id="mtr1-3"> 
  <h1 class="entry-title">MTR 1.3 Tournament Roles</h1> 
 </header>
 <div class="entry-content"> 
  <p> The following roles are defined for tournament purposes:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Tournament Organizer</li> 
   <li>Head Judge</li> 
   <li>Floor Judge</li> 
   <li>Scorekeeper</li> 
   <li>Player</li> 
   <li>Spectator</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>The first four roles above are considered tournament officials. The Head Judge and floor judges are collectively considered judges. A single individual may act in any combination of tournament official roles. Individuals who are not judges at a tournament are acting as spectators in any match they are not playing in. Members of the press are also considered spectators.</p>  
 </div>
 <header class="entry-header" id="mtr1-4"> 
  <h1 class="entry-title">MTR 1.4 Participation Eligibility</h1> 
 </header>
 <div class="entry-content"> 
  <p>Anyone is eligible to participate as a player in a DCI-sanctioned tournament except for:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Individuals currently suspended by the DCI. The current DCI suspended player list is located at <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dci/suspended">http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dci/suspended</a>. Individuals currently suspended from the DCI may not act as tournament officials;</li> 
   <li>Other individuals specifically prohibited from participation by DCI or Wizards of the Coast policy (such determination is at Wizards of the Coast's sole discretion);<br> </li> 
   <li>Individuals thirteen (13) years of age and younger who do not have their parent/guardians' permission;<br> </li> 
   <li>Anyone prohibited by federal, state, or local laws, the rules of the Tournament Organizer, or by a venue's management.<br> </li> 
   <li>Tournament Organizers may choose to age restrict any Regular REL events that they organize. They must clearly indicate this in their marketing for the event on the Store and Event Locator description as well as any other place they display the event information. (i.e. Tournament Organizers may advertise an age 16 and under Friday Night Magic).</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>Anyone is eligible to participate as a tournament official (Tournament Organizer, Head Judge, floor judge or Scorekeeper) for a tournament with the exception of:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Individuals currently suspended by the DCI;<br> </li> 
   <li>Anyone who has played in the tournament, unless it is a tournament that explicitly allows tournament officials to play while acting as a tournament official.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>Tournament officials may play in a DCI-sanctioned, rated tournament for which they are a tournament official if (and only if) the tournament is of the following event types:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Friday Night <strong>Magic</strong></li> 
   <li>Prerelease</li> 
   <li>Standard Showdown</li> 
   <li>Draft Weekend</li> 
   <li>Other non-Premier <strong>Magic</strong> Tournaments</li> 
   <li>Tournaments in which the official Wizards of the Coast tournament fact sheet specifically permits officials of that tournament to play</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>If one or more tournament officials play in the tournament, it must be run at Regular Rules Enforcement Level. If tournament officials play in the tournament and the tournament is not one of the allowed event types listed above, the tournament will be invalidated. Tournament officials are required to officiate tournaments fairly and without regard to their own self-interest.</p> 
  <p>The owners of organizations that run Premier Events are not permitted to play in those events, even if the owner is not listed as a tournament official (organizer, judge, and/or scorekeeper) for that tournament.</p> 
  <p><span>Premier Events include the following tournaments: </span><b>Magic: The Gathering </b><span>World Championship, </span><b>Magic</b><span> Players Tour,&nbsp;</span><span> Players Tour Finals, WPN Qualifiers, WPN Preliminary Events, Players Tour Qualifiers, Magic Premier Series, Grand Prix, and Grand Prix Trials.</span></p> 
  <p><span>Some tournaments have additional criteria regarding player and tournament official eligibility (e.g. invitation-only tournaments, such as </span><span> Players Tour and Player Tour Finals)</span></p> 
  <p>The Players Tour Invitation Policy defines specific eligibility rules with regards to certain types of invitation-only Premier Tournaments (e.g. <span> Players Tour and Players Tour Finals</span>).</p> 
  <p>Individuals with questions regarding their tournament eligibility should contact the DCI policy manager via (<a href="mailto:esports@wizards.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">esports@wizards.com</a>).</p>

 <header class="entry-header" id="mtr1-5"> 
  <h1 class="entry-title">MTR 1.5 DCI Number</h1> 
 </header>
 <div class="entry-content"> 
  <p>Tournament participants must provide their DCI membership number to the Scorekeeper during registration.</p>  
  <p>Players without a DCI membership number must request one from the Tournament Organizer. There is no cost associated with joining the DCI, but members are only allowed one DCI membership number.</p>  
  <p>Results containing temporary player numbers, temporary player names, or placeholders may not be reported to the DCI.</p>  
 </div>
 <header class="entry-header" id="mtr1-6"> 
  <h1 class="entry-title">MTR 1.6 Tournament Organizer</h1> 
 </header>
 <div class="entry-content"> 
  <p>The Tournament Organizer of a tournament is responsible for all tournament logistics including:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Securing a sanctioning number from the DCI.</li>  
   <li>Providing a site for the tournament that meets the tournament's expected needs.</li>  
   <li>Advertising the tournament in advance of the tournament date.</li>  
   <li>Staffing the tournament with appropriate tournament officials.</li>  
   <li>Providing all materials necessary to operate the tournament (e.g. product for Limited format tournaments).</li>  
   <li>Reporting the tournament results to the DCI.</li> 
   <li>Saving match result slips from each tournament for a period of 6 months (to aid in match appeals).</li> 
  </ul> 
 </div>
 <header class="entry-header" id="mtr1-7"> 
  <h1 class="entry-title">MTR 1.7 Head Judge</h1> 
 </header>
 <div class="entry-content"> 
  <p>Sanctioned tournaments require the physical presence of a Head Judge during play to adjudicate disputes, interpret rules, and make other official decisions. The Head Judge is the final judicial authority at any DCI-sanctioned tournament and all tournament participants are expected to follow their interpretation. Although it is beneficial, the Head Judge does not have to be certified.</p>  
  <p>The Head Judge's responsibilities include:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Ensuring that all necessary steps are taken to deal with game or policy rule violations that they notice or are brought to their attention.<br> </li> 
  </ul> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Issuing the final ruling in all appeals, potentially overturning the ruling of a floor judge.<br> </li> 
   <li>Coordinating and delegating tasks to floor judges as needed.<br> </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>If necessary, the Head Judge may temporarily transfer their duties to any judge if they are unable to fulfill them for a period of time. Also, in exceptional circumstances, if the tournament's integrity would be damaged otherwise, the Tournament Organizer may replace the Head Judge.</p>  
  <p>Certain Premier tournaments have multiple Head Judges and/or different Head Judges for different portions of the tournament. All Head Judges share the same responsibilities and exercise the same authority while they are serving as a Head Judge.</p>  
 </div>
 <header class="entry-header" id="mtr1-8"> 
  <h1 class="entry-title">MTR 1.8 Floor Judges</h1> 
 </header>
 <div class="entry-content"> 
  <p>Floor judges are available to players and spectators to answer questions, deal with illegal plays, or assist with reasonable requests. They do not have to be certified.</p>  
  <p>Judges will not generally assist players in determining the current game state but can answer questions about the rules, interactions between cards, or provide the Oracle(TM) wordings of relevant cards.</p>  
  <p>At Regular Rules Enforcement Level, the judge may assist the player in understanding the game state in the interest of education.</p>  
  <p>If a player wishes to ask their question away from the table, the request will usually be honored.</p>  
  <p>Players may not request specific judges to answer their calls, but may request a tournament official to help translate. This request may be honored at the discretion of the original judge.</p>  
  <p>Judges do not intervene in a game to prevent illegal actions, but do intervene as soon as a rule has been broken or to prevent a situation from escalating.</p>  
 </div>
 <header class="entry-header" id="mtr1-9"> 
  <h1 class="entry-title">MTR 1.9 Scorekeeper</h1> 
 </header>
 <div class="entry-content"> 
  <p>The Scorekeeper ensures the correct generation of pairings and all other tournament records throughout the tournament.</p>  
  <p>The Scorekeeper's responsibilities include:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Generating correct pairings each round and accurately entering the results of those rounds.</li> 
   <li>Generating standings for posting before and after the final Swiss round. Other rounds may also be posted at the Head Judge's discretion.</li> 
   <li>Solving all scorekeeping problems that arise in consultation with the Head Judge.</li> 
   <li>Making sure all necessary information is included in the tournament's report to be submitted to the DCI.</li> 
  </ul>  
  <p>The Head Judge has the final authority in determining corrective action for scorekeeping errors.</p>

 <header class="entry-header" id="mtr1-10"> 
  <h1 class="entry-title">MTR 1.10 Players</h1> 
 </header>
 <div class="entry-content"> 
  <p>Players are responsible for:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Behaving in a respectful manner toward tournament officials, other tournament participants, and spectators and refraining from unsporting conduct at all times.<br> </li> 
   <li>Maintaining a clear and legal game state.<br> </li> 
   <li>Complying with announced start times and time limits.<br> </li> 
   <li>Calling attention to any rules or policy infraction they notice in their matches.<br> </li> 
   <li>Bringing to a judge's attention any discrepancies in their tournament match record.<br> </li> 
   <li>Informing the DCI of any discrepancies in their overall match history, rankings, or Planeswalker Points as soon as they become aware of it. If players believe there is an anomaly in their match history, ranking, or Planeswalker Points they should refer to the <strong>Magic: The Gathering</strong> Event Appeals Policy, located at <a href="http://wpn.wizards.com/en/document/magic-event-appeals-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://wpn.wizards.com/en/document/magic-event-appeals-policy</a>.<br> </li> 
   <li>Having a single DCI membership number. Individuals holding more than one number must contact Wizards of the Coast Customer Service at <a href="http://www.wizards.com/customerservice" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.wizards.com/customerservice</a> so that their numbers can be merged.<br> </li> 
   <li><span>Refraining from enrolling in tournaments in which they are not allowed by policy to participate.</span><br> </li> 
   <li>Being familiar with the rules contained within this document.<br> </li> 
   <li>Being physically present for the tournament. Players are not permitted to register for a tournament solely to collect participation Planeswalker Points.<br> </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>A player must bring the following items to a tournament in order to participate:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>A physical, visible, and reliable method to maintain and record game information (tokens, score counters, pen and paper, and so on).<br> </li> 
   <li>A valid DCI membership number registered in the participant's name. New players may register for DCI membership when enrolling in the tournament.<br> </li> 
   <li>Any materials specifically required for a particular tournament format, such as assembled decks and/or decklists for constructed tournaments.<br> </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>Players retain their responsibilities even if a judge provides them with extra assistance.</p>  
  <p>The individual members of a team are considered players, and are equally responsible for required tournament procedures, such as accurately filling out their match result slips. Players are only responsible for the games they play themselves and not separate games being played by their teammates, but are expected to point out rules violations they observe in their teammates' matches.</p>  
  <p>Players who do not fulfill their responsibilities may be subject to penalties and review by the DCI. Wizards of the Coast and the DCI reserve the right to suspend or revoke a player's membership without prior notice for any reason they deem necessary.</p>

  <h1 class="entry-title">MTR 1.11 Spectators</h1> 
 </header>
 <div class="entry-content"> 
  <p>Any person physically present at a tournament and not in any other category above is a spectator. Spectators are responsible for remaining silent and passive during matches and other official tournament sections in which players are also required to be silent.</p>  
  <p>If spectators believe they have observed a rules or policy violation, they are encouraged to alert a judge as soon as possible. At Regular or Competitive Rules Enforcement Level, spectators are permitted to ask the players to pause the match while they alert a judge. At Professional Rules Enforcement Level, spectators who are not members of the official coverage team must not interfere with the match directly.</p>  
  <p>Players may request that a spectator not observe their matches. Such requests must be made through a judge. Tournament officials may also instruct a spectator not observe a match or matches.</p>

 <header class="entry-header" id="mtr1-12"> 
  <h1 class="entry-title">MTR 1.12 Rules Enforcement Levels</h1> 
 </header>
 <div class="entry-content"> 
  <p>Rules Enforcement Levels (REL) are a means to communicate to the players and judges what expectations they can have of the tournament in terms of rigidity of rules enforcement, technically correct play, and procedures used.</p>  
  <p>The Rules Enforcement Level of a tournament generally reflects the prizes awarded and the distance a player may be expected to travel.</p>  
  <p>The appropriate Rules Enforcement Level for specific programs is listed in <a href="#mtr-appendix-f">Appendix F</a>.</p> 
  <p><strong>Regular</strong></p> 
  <p>Regular tournaments are focused on fun and social aspects, not enforcement. Most tournaments are run at this level unless they offer sizeable prizes or invitations. Players are expected to know most of the game rules, may have heard of policy and what is "really bad," but generally play in a fashion similar to the way they do casually. Players are still responsible for following the rules, but the focus is on education and sportsmanship over technically precise play. Infractions in these tournaments are covered by the Judging at Regular Rules Enforcement Level document, located at <a href="http://wpn.wizards.com/en/node/61" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://wpn.wizards.com/en/node/61</a>.</p>  
  <p><strong>Competitive</strong></p> 
  <p>Competitive tournaments are usually those with significant cash prizes or invitations awarded to Professional tournaments. Players are expected to know the game's rules and be familiar with the policies and procedures, but unintentional errors are not punished severely. These are tournaments that protect the interests of all players by providing tournament integrity while also recognizing that not all players are intimately familiar with Professional-level tournament structure, proper procedures, and rules. Infractions in these tournaments are covered by the Magic Infraction Procedure Guide, located at <a href="http://wpn.wizards.com/en/document/magic-infraction-procedure-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://wpn.wizards.com/en/document/magic-infraction-procedure-guide</a>.</p>  
  <p><strong>Professional</strong></p> 
  <p>Professional level tournaments offer large cash awards, prestige, and other benefits that draw players from great distances. These tournaments hold players to a higher standard of behavior and technically-correct play than Competitive tournaments. Infractions in these tournaments are covered by the Magic Infraction Procedure Guide, located at <a href="http://wpn.wizards.com/en/document/magic-infraction-procedure-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://wpn.wizards.com/en/document/magic-infraction-procedure-guide</a>.</p>

  <h1 class="entry-title">MTR 2.1 Match Structure</h1> 
 </header>
 <div class="entry-content"> 
  <p>A <strong>Magic</strong> match consists of a series of games that are played until one side has won a set number of games, usually two. Drawn games do not count toward this goal.</p>

  <h1 class="entry-title">MTR 2.2 Play/Draw Rule</h1> 
 </header>
 <div class="entry-content"> 
  <p>For the first game of a match, a designated player - the winner of a random method (such as a die roll or coin toss) during Swiss rounds, or the player ranked higher at the end of Swiss rounds during playoff matches - chooses either to play first or to play second.</p>  
  <p>They must state this choice before looking at their hand. If they state no choice, it is assumed that they are playing first.</p>  
  <p>The player who plays first skips the draw step of their first turn. This is referred to as the play/draw rule.</p>  
  <p>After each game in a match, the loser of that game decides whether to play first in the next game. They may wait until after sideboarding to make the decision. If the previous game was a draw, the player who decided to play or draw at the beginning of the drawn game chooses.</p>

  <h1 class="entry-title">MTR 2.3 Pregame Procedures</h1> 
 </header>
 <div class="entry-content"> 
  <p>The following steps must be performed in a timely manner before each game begins:</p>  
  <ol> 
   <li>If sideboarding is allowed, players may remove cards from their decks and add cards from their sideboards.<br> </li> 
   <li>Players shuffle their decks. Steps 1 and 2 may be repeated.<br> </li> 
   <li>Players present their decks to their opponents for additional shuffling. The sideboard (if any) is also presented at this time.<br> </li> 
   <li>The appropriate player must decide whether to play first or second at this point, if they haven't done so already (see section 2.2).<br> </li> 
   <li>Each player draws seven cards. Optionally, these cards may be dealt face down on the table.<br> </li> 
   <li>Each player, in turn order, may take mulligans. (Rules on mulligans can be found in the <strong>Magic</strong> Comprehensive Rules, rule 103.4). <span>If a player takes a mulligan, they shuffle again and repeat the presentation process described above.</span><br> </li> 
  </ol> 
  <p>The game is considered to have begun once all players have completed taking mulligans. Pregame procedures may be performed before time for the match has officially begun.</p>

  <h1 class="entry-title">MTR 2.4 Conceding or Intentionally Drawing Games or Matches</h1> 
 </header>
 <div class="entry-content"> 
  <p>If a game or match is not completed, players may concede or mutually agree to a draw in that game or match.</p>  
  <p>A match is considered complete once the result slip is filled out or, if match slips are not being used, a player leaves the table after game play is finished.</p>  
  <p>Until that point, either player may concede to or draw with the other, though if the conceding player won a game in the match, the match must be reported as 2-1. Intentional draws where no games were played are always reported as 0-0-3 or by using the "draw" button (0-0) in Wizards Event Reporter (WER).</p>  
  <p>Players may not agree to a concession or draw in exchange for any reward or incentive. Doing so will be considered Bribery (see <a href="#mtr5-2">section 5.2</a>).</p>  
  <p>If a player refuses to play, it is assumed that they have conceded the match.</p>

  <h1 class="entry-title">MTR 2.5 End-of-Match Procedure</h1> 
 </header>
 <div class="entry-content"> 
  <p>If the match time limit is reached before a winner is determined, the player whose turn it is finishes their turn and five additional turns are played in total.</p>  
  <p>This usually means that one player takes three turns and the other two, but a player taking extra turns may affect this.</p>  
  <p><span> If the active player has already&nbsp;indicated that they'd like to pass the turn when the time limit is reached, that is considered to be in their opponent's next turn.</span></p> 
  <p>Team tournaments featuring multiple players playing together (such as Two-Headed Giant) use three turns instead of five.</p>  
  <p>Once time is called, no new games should begin.</p>  
  <p>If the game is incomplete at the end of additional turns, the game is considered a draw.</p>  
  <p>If a judge assigned a time extension (because of a long ruling, deck check, or other reason) the end-of-match procedure does not begin until the end of the time extension.</p>  
  <p>In single-elimination rounds, matches may not end in a draw.</p>  
  <p>If all players have equal game wins at the end of additional turns, the player with the highest life total wins the current game. In the event all players have equal life totals (or are between games and the game wins are tied), the game/match continues with an additional state- based action: if a player does not have the highest life total, they lose the game. Two-Headed Giant teams are treated as a single player for determining a game winner.</p>

  <h1 class="entry-title">MTR 2.6 Time Extensions</h1> 
 </header>
 <div class="entry-content"> 
  <p>If a judge pauses a match for more than one minute while the round clock is running, they should extend the match time appropriately.</p>  
  <p>If the match was interrupted to perform a deck check, players are awarded time equal to the time the deck check took plus three minutes.</p>  
  <p>Feature matches at a tournament with online coverage receive a time extension equal to three minutes plus time elapsed in the round when players reach their table. This is not necessary if feature matches are being timed separately.</p>  
  <p>Certain slow play penalties add turns rather than a time extension. These additional turns are added to the end-of-match additional turns.</p>

 <div class="entry-content"> 
  <p>Players are required to register their decks and sideboards (if applicable) in Competitive and Professional Rules Enforcement Level tournaments. The Head Judge may require registration in Regular Rules Enforcement Level tournaments.</p>  
  <p>Registered decklists record the original composition of each deck and sideboard (if applicable). Once your decklist has been accepted by a Tournament Official it may not be altered.</p>  
  <p>In Constructed tournaments, decklists must be submitted to a tournament official prior to the start of round 1, even if the player has an awarded bye for that round.</p> 
  <p>In Limited tournaments, decklists must be submitted prior to the start of the first round in which that player participates and does not have an awarded bye.</p>  
  <p>Players have the right to request to see their decklist between matches. Such a request will be honored if logistically possible.</p>  
  <p>Generally, decklists are not public information and are not shared with other players during a tournament.

  <p>Players may drop from a tournament at any time. If a player drops from a tournament before the first round of play has started, they are considered to have not participated in the tournament and will not be listed in the finish order nor receive participation Planeswalker Points.</p>  
  <p>Players choosing to drop from a tournament must inform the Scorekeeper by the means provided for that tournament before the pairings for the next round are generated.</p>  
  <p>Players wanting to drop after the Scorekeeper begins pairing for the next round will be paired for that round.</p>  
  <p>If a player does not show up for their match, they will be automatically dropped from the tournament unless they report to the Scorekeeper. Players that repeatedly and/or intentionally drop from tournaments without informing the scorekeepers of those tournaments may be the subject of penalties up to and including suspension.</p>  
  <p>Players who drop during limited tournaments own the cards that they correctly have in their possession at that time. This includes any unopened or partially drafted boosters.</p>  
  <p>If a player drops from a tournament after a cut has been made, such as a cut to the Top 8 playoff in a Grand Prix tournament, no other player is advanced as a replacement. The highest ranked remaining player receives a bye for the round instead.</p>  
  <p>Players who have dropped may reenter a tournament at the discretion of the Head Judge. Players may not reenter a portion of the tournament that requires a deck built during a construction period that the player missed. Players may not reenter a tournament after any cut has been made.</p>

   <li>The card is genuine and published by Wizards of the Coast<br> </li> 
   <li>The card has a standard <strong>Magic</strong> back or is a double-faced card, or is a card that is part of a meld pair.<br> </li>

  <p>Hidden information refers to the faces of cards and other objects at which the rules of the game and format do not allow you to look.</p>  
  <p>Throughout the match, a draft, and pregame procedures, players are responsible for keeping their cards above the level of the playing surface and for making reasonable efforts to prevent hidden information from being revealed.

 <div class="entry-content"> 
  <p>A sideboard is a group of additional cards the player may use to modify their deck between games of a match. The player may use these cards in their main deck during all games after the first one in a match.</p>  
  <p>Before each game begins, players must present their sideboard (if any) face down. Opponents may count the number of cards in their opponent's sideboard at any time. Players are not required to reveal how many cards they have swapped from their main deck to their sideboard and do not have to swap one for one.</p>  
  <p>Other items (token cards, double-faced card represented in the deck by a checklist card, etc.) should be kept separate from the sideboard during game play.</p>  
  <p>During a game, players may look at their own sideboard, keeping it clearly distinguishable from other cards at all times. If a player gains control of another player, they may not look at that player's sideboard, nor may they have that player access their sideboard.</p>  
  <p>The deck and sideboard must each be returned to their original compositions before the first game of each match.</p>  
  <p>Restrictions on the composition and use of a sideboard can be found in the deck construction rules for a particular format type.</p>  
  <p>If a penalty causes a player to lose the first game in a match before that game has begun, or the first game is intentionally drawn before any cards are played, neither player may use cards from their sideboard for the next game in the match.</p>

  <h1 class="entry-title">MTR 4.1 Player Communication</h1> 
 </header>
 <div class="entry-content"> 
  <p>Communication between players is essential to the successful play of any game that involves virtual objects or hidden information. While bluffing may be an aspect of games, there need to be clear lines as to what is, and is not, acceptable for players to say or otherwise represent. This will confirm expectations of both sporting and competitive players during a game.</p>  
  <p>A player should have an advantage due to better understanding of the options provided by the rules of the game, greater awareness of the interactions in the current game state, and superior tactical planning.</p>  
  <p>Players are under no obligation to assist their opponents in playing the game. Regardless of anything else, players are expected to treat opponents politely and with respect. Failure to do so may lead to Unsporting Conduct penalties.</p>  
  <p>There are four categories of information: status, free, derived and private.</p> 
  <p>Status information is information that must be announced upon change and physically tracked by the affected player. Methods for tracking must be visible to both players during the match. A shared method is acceptable as long as all players in the match have access to it. At Competitive and Professional REL, methods that can easily be accidentally changed (such as dice) may not be used. Status information consists of:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Life totals.</li> 
   <li>Counters a player has attached to them.</li> 
   <li>Continuous effects with no defined expiration within the game that apply to that player, such as Monarch or City's Blessing</li> 
   <li><span>Unspent mana in a player's mana pool.</span></li> 
  </ul>  
  <p>Free information is information to which all players are entitled access without contamination or omissions made by their opponents. If a player is ever unable or unwilling to provide free information to an opponent that has requested it, they should call a judge and explain the situation.</p> 
  <p>Free information consists of:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Details of current game actions and past game actions that still affect the game state.</li> 
   <li>The name of any visible object.</li> 
   <li>The number and type of any counter that isn't defined as status information.</li> 
   <li>The state (whether it's tapped, attached to another permanent, face down, etc.) and current zone of any object or player.</li> 
   <li>The game score of the current match.</li> 
   <li>The current step and/or phase and which player(s) are active.</li> 
  </ul>  
  <p>Derived information is information to which all players are entitled access, but opponents are not obliged to assist in determining and may require some skill or calculation to determine. Derived information consists of:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>The number of any type of objects present in any game zone that are not defined as free information.</li> 
   <li>All characteristics of objects in public zones that are not defined as free or status information.</li> 
   <li>Game Rules, Tournament Policy, Oracle content and any other official information pertaining to the current tournament. Cards are considered to have their Oracle text printed on them.</li> 
  </ul>  
  <p>Private information is information to which players have access only if they are able to determine it from the current visual game state or their own record of previous game actions.</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Any information that is not free or derived is automatically private information.</li> 
  </ul>  
  <p>The following rules govern player communication:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Players must answer all questions asked of them by a judge completely and honestly, regardless of the type of information requested. Players may request to do so away from the match.</li> 
   <li>Players may not represent derived, free, or status information incorrectly.</li> 
   <li>Players must answer completely and honestly any specific questions pertaining to free information.</li> 
   <li>At Regular Rules Enforcement Level, all derived information is instead considered free.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>Judges are encouraged to help players in determining free and status information, but must avoid assisting players with derived information about the game state.</p>

  <h1 class="entry-title">MTR 4.2 Tournament Shortcuts</h1> 
 </header>
 <div class="entry-content"> 
  <p>A tournament shortcut is an action taken by players to skip parts of the technical play sequence without explicitly announcing them. Tournament shortcuts are essential for the smooth play of a game, as they allow players to play in a clear fashion without getting bogged down in the minutiae of the rules.</p>  
  <p>Most tournament shortcuts involve skipping one or more priority passes to the mutual understanding of all players;</p>  
  <p>If a player wishes to demonstrate or use a new tournament shortcut entailing any number of priority passes, they must be clear where the game state will end up as part of the request.</p>  
  <p>A player may interrupt a tournament shortcut by explaining how they are deviating from it or at which point in the middle they wish to take an action. A player may interrupt their own shortcut in this manner.</p>  
  <p>A player is not allowed to use a previously undeclared tournament shortcut, or to modify an in-use tournament shortcut without announcing the modification, in order to create ambiguity in the game.</p> 
  <p>A player may not request priority and take no action with it. If a player decides they do not wish to do anything, the request is nullified and priority is returned to the player that originally had it.</p>  
  <p>During the resolution of one of their spells or abilities, a player may not assume their opponent has taken a shortcut. They must seek confirmation that a choice with no visible impact was taken.</p>  
  <p>Certain conventional tournament shortcuts used in <strong>Magic</strong> are detailed below.</p>  
  <p>They define a default communication; if a player wishes to deviate from these, they should be explicit about doing so.</p>  
  <p>Note that some of these are exceptions to the policy above in that they do cause non-explicit priority passes.</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>If the active player passes priority with an empty stack during their first main phase, the non-active player is assumed to be acting in beginning of combat<br> <br> unless they are affecting whether a beginning of combat ability triggers.<br> <br> Then, after those actions resolve or no actions took place, the active player receives priority at the beginning of combat.<br> <br> Beginning of combat triggered abilities (even ones that target) may be announced at this time.<br> </li> 
   <li>If the active player passes priority with an empty stack during their second main phase, or uses a phrase such as "Go" or "Your Turn" at any time, the non-active player is assumed to be acting in the end step unless they are affecting how or whether an end of turn ability triggers.<br> <br> End of turn triggered abilities that do not target resolve after the non-active player passes priority.<br> </li> 
   <li>Whenever a player adds an object to the stack, they are assumed to be passing priority unless they explicitly announce that they intend to retain it.<br> </li> 
   <li>If a player adds a group of objects to the stack without explicitly retaining priority, they are assumed to be adding them to the stack individually and allowing each to resolve before adding the next. If another player wishes to take an action at a point in the middle of this sequence, the actions should be reversed to that point.<br> </li> 
   <li>If a player casts a spell or activates an ability and announces choices for it that are not normally made until resolution, the player must adhere to those choices unless an opponent responds to that spell or ability. If an opponent inquires about choices made during resolution, that player is assumed to be passing priority and allowing that spell or ability to resolve.<br> </li> 
   <li>A player is assumed to have paid any cost of 0 unless they announce otherwise.<br> </li> 
   <li>A player who casts a spell or activates an ability that targets an object on the stack is assumed to target the legal target closest to the top of the stack unless the player specifies otherwise.</li> 
   <li>A player is assumed to be attacking another player with their creatures and not any planeswalkers that player may control unless the attacking player specifies otherwise.<br> </li> 
   <li>A player who does not scry/surveil (or look at the top card of the library after taking a mulligan) when instructed to is assumed to have not looked and chosen to leave the cards in the same order.<br> </li> 
   <li>In the Two-Headed Giant format, attacking creatures are assumed to be attacking the head of the defending player sitting directly across from their controller, unless the creature's controller specifies otherwise.<br> <em></em></li>

  <h1 class="entry-title">MTR 4.3 Out-of-Order Sequencing</h1> 
 </header>
 <div class="entry-content"> 
  <p>Due to the complexity of accurately representing a game of <strong>Magic</strong>, it is acceptable for players to engage in a block of actions that, while technically in an incorrect order, arrive at a legal and clearly understood game state once they are complete.</p>  
  <p>All actions taken must be legal if they were executed in the correct order, and any opponent can ask the player to do the actions in the correct sequence so that they can respond at the appropriate time (at which point players will not be held to any still-pending actions).</p>  
  <p>An out-of-order sequence must not result in a player prematurely gaining information which could reasonably affect decisions made later in that sequence.</p>  
  <p>Players may not try to use opponent's reactions to some portion of an out-of-order sequence to see if they should modify actions or try to take additional ones. Nor may players use Out-of-Order Sequencing to try to retroactively take an action they missed at the appropriate time. In general, any substantial pause at the end of a completed batch is an indication that all actions have been taken, the sequence is complete and the game has moved to the appropriate point at the end of the sequence.</p>  
  <p><em><strong>Examples:</strong></em><br> 1. A player discards a card to pay for <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore" class="jTip" name="">Masticore</a>'s upkeep cost before untapping their lands.<br> 2. A player resolves <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harrow" class="jTip" name="">Harrow</a> and puts the card into their graveyard, then searches.<br> 3. While resolving <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Restore+Balance" class="jTip" name="">Restore Balance</a>, a player discards before sacrificing lands and creatures.<br> 4. A player with two creatures being put into the graveyard due to state-based actions resolves the leaves-the-battlefield triggered ability on one of them before putting the other creature in the graveyard.<br> 5. A player declares a blocker, animates a <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village" class="jTip" name="">Treetop Village</a>, and then attempts to block with that Treetop Village.</p>

  <h1 class="entry-title">MTR 4.4 Loops</h1> 
 </header>
 <div class="entry-content"> 
  <p>A loop is a form of tournament shortcut that involves detailing a sequence of actions to be repeated and then performing a number of iterations of that sequence. The loop actions must be identical in each iteration and cannot include conditional actions ("If this, then that".)</p> 
  <p>If no players are involved in maintaining the loop, each player in turn order chooses a number of iterations to perform before they will take an action to break the loop or that they wish to take no action. If all players choose to take no action, the game is a draw. Otherwise, the game advances through the lowest number of iterations chosen and the player who chose that number takes an action to break the loop.</p> 
  <p>If one player is involved in maintaining the loop, they choose a number of iterations. The other players, in turn order, agree to that number or announce a lower number after which they intend to intervene. The game advances through the lowest number of iterations chosen and the player who chose that number receives priority.</p> 
  <p>If two or more players are involved in maintaining a loop within a turn, each player in turn order chooses a number of iterations to perform. The game advances through the lowest number of iterations chosen and the player who chose that number receives priority.</p> 
  <p>Loops may span multiple turns if a game state is not meaningfully changing. Note that drawing cards other than the ones being used to sustain the loop is a meaningful change. If two or more players are involved in maintaining a loop across turns, each player chooses a number of iterations to perform, or announces their intent to continue indefinitely. If all players choose to continue indefinitely, the game is a draw. Otherwise, the game advances through the lowest number of iterations chosen and the player who chose that number receives priority at the point they stop taking an action to sustain the loop.</p> 
  <p>A player intervening during a loop may specify that one iteration of the loop is only partly performed in order to be able to take action at the appropriate point. If they do, the final iteration is only performed up to the chosen point.</p> 
  <p>Non-deterministic loops (loops that rely on decision trees, probability or mathematical convergence) may not be shortcut. A player attempting to execute a nondeterministic loop must stop if at any point during the process a previous game state (or one identical in all relevant ways) is reached again. This happens most often in loops that involve shuffling a library.</p> 
  <p><span>Some loops are sustained by choices rather than actions. In these cases, the rules above may be applied, with the player making a different choice rather than ceasing to take an action. The game moves to the point where the player makes that choice. If the choice involves hidden information, a judge may be needed to determine whether any choice is available that will not continue the loop.</span></p> 
  <p>The judge is the final arbiter of what constitutes a loop. A player may not 'opt-out' of shortcutting a loop, nor may they make irrelevant changes between iterations in an attempt to make it appear as though there is no loop. Once a loop has been shortcut, it may not be restarted until the game has changed in a relevant way. Proposing loops as an effort to use up time on the clock is Stalling.</p>

 <div class="entry-content"> 
  <p>Players in Competitive and Professional Rules Enforcement Level matches must arrange their cards, tokens, and other accessories on the battlefield using the following layout:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>From the player's perspective, nonlands must be kept closer to the player's opponent than lands, and no non-land cards should be between the land area and the edge of the table closest to the player.</li> 
   <li>Non-creature permanents whose use may reasonably be associated with either the land or nonland area (e.g. an artifact whose only ability is a mana ability) may be located in either area, provided the overall layout is, in the judgment of tournament officials, clear. However, permanents that are also creatures (e.g. artifacts with March of the Machines on the battlefield, Dryad Arbor, or a Treetop Village that is currently a creature) must be placed in the nonland area. Players may not use other cards to intentionally obscure the presence of a permanent in any area of the battlefield.</li> 
   <li>Each card should remain clearly associated with any permanents attached to it. For example, an Aura enchanting a land should be in the land area in contact with that land.</li> 
   <li>The player's library, graveyard, and exiled cards should be kept all to the left of the battlefield or all to the right of the battlefield at the player's discretion.</li> 
   <li>The player's graveyard and exiled cards should be adjacent to the player's library. All three should be distinct at all times.</li> 
   <li>If a card is exiled by a permanent and that permanent includes a way to perform additional actions with the exiled card, the association of the two cards must be clear. Keeping the two cards together is recommended.</li> 
   <li>Each untapped permanent should face its controller. Players are permitted to briefly turn a card upside-down as a memory aid. </li> 
  </ul>  
  <p><span>Physical objects used to represent permanents must have a way of clearly representing any in-game status, such as whether a permanent is tapped. Sleeves or card backs that appear similar to any player's sleeves or card backs may not be used. The Head Judge is the final authority on what may be used to represent permanents.</span></p> 
  <p>Tournament officials may make exceptions or additions to these guidelines at their sole discretion in order to keep each player's game layout clear. Players in exceptional situations (e.g. a player playing a deck with no lands or a deck that makes significant use of the graveyard) should consult with tournament officials to determine what allowances, if any, will be made.</p>

  <p><i><span></span></i></p>
  <p></p> 
  <p>Sometimes, a player will realize that they have made a wrong decision after making a play. If that player has not gained any information since taking the action and they wish to make a different decision, a judge may allow that player to change their mind.</p> 
  <p><i><span></span></i></p>
  <p></p> 
  <p>Judges must carefully consider whether the player has gained information since making the play that might have affected the decision;</p> 
  <p><i><span></span></i></p>
  <p></p> 
  <p>in particular, players may not try to use opponent reactions (or lack thereof) to see if they should modify actions they committed to.</p>

 <div class="entry-content"> 
  <p><span>The decision to drop, concede, or agree to an intentional draw cannot be made in exchange for or influenced by the offer of any reward or incentive, nor may any in-game decision be influenced in this manner. Making such an offer or enticing someone into making an offer is prohibited and is considered bribery.</span></p>  
  <p>&nbsp;</p> 
  <p><span>Players may not make any offers to tournament officials in an attempt to influence the outcome of a ruling.</span></p>  
  <p><span>It is not bribery when players share prizes they have not yet received in the current tournament and they may agree to such before or during their match, as long as any such sharing does not occur in exchange for any game or match result or the dropping of a player from the tournament.</span></p> 
  <p>It is not bribery when players in the announced last round of the single-elimination portion of a tournament agree to a winner and how to divide the subsequent tournament prizes. In that case, one of the players at each table must agree to drop from the tournament. Players receive the prizes according to their final ranking.</p>  
  <p><span>The result of a match or game may not be randomly or arbitrarily determined through any means other than the normal progress of the game in play. Examples include (but are not limited to) rolling a die, flipping a coin, arm wrestling, or playing any other game.</span></p>  
  <p><span>Players may not reach an agreement in conjunction with other matches. Players can make use of information regarding match or game scores of other tables. However, players are not allowed to leave their seats during their match or go to great lengths to obtain this information.</span></p>  
  <p><span>Players in the single-elimination rounds of a tournament offering only cash, store credit, prize tickets, and/or unopened product as prizes may, with the permission of the Tournament Organizer, agree to split the prizes evenly.

  <p><strong><i>Example</i></strong><span>: Before the semifinals of a tournament (in which first place gets 12 packs, second place gets 8 packs and 3rd and 4th get 4 packs each) begins, the players may get permission from the Tournament Organizer to end the tournament, with each player receiving 7 packs.</span></p> 
  <p><span><strong>Example</strong>: In the finals of a 1-slot <b>Magic</b> Tabletop Mythic Qualifier that offers a travel award and an invitation to the winner, the two finalists may agree to split the tournament prizes, but this agreement cannot alter the results of the match. One player must drop from the tournament, leaving the travel award and the invitation to the player who did not drop from the tournament.

  <p>Cards must be received directly from tournament officials. This product must be new and previously unopened. <b>Magic</b><span> Tabletop Mythic Championship</span>, Grand Prix, and World Championship tournaments may have had boosters opened in order to stamp them. Each player (or team) must be given exactly the same quantity and type of product as all other players participating in the tournament. For example, if one player receives three <em>Magic Origins</em> boosters for a booster draft, all other players must also receive three <em>Magic Origins</em> boosters.</p> 
  <p>Only cards from the expansions of the boosters opened (and only cards opened or drafted in that player's pool) may be used in a player's deck. The following are exceptions to this rule:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Players may add an unlimited number of cards named Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, or Forest to their deck and sideboard. They may not add additional snow basic land cards (e.g. Snow-Covered Forest, etc) or Wastes basic land cards, even in formats in which they are legal.</li> 
   <li>Non-basic lands from the <em>Return to Ravnica</em> and <em>Gatecrash</em> expansions are allowed when opened in <em>Dragon's Maze</em> boosters.</li> 
   <li>Non-basic lands from the <em>Khans of Tarkir</em> expansion are allowed when opened in <em>Fate Reforged</em> boosters.</li> 
   <li>Non-basic lands from the <em>Zendikar Expeditions</em> set are allowed when opened in <em>Battle for Zendikar </em>or<em> Oath of the Gatewatch</em> boosters.</li> 
   <li>Cards from a <em>Masterpiece Series</em> are allowed when opened in boosters associated with that series.</li> 
   <li>Prerelease tournaments may feature additional exceptions. These will be announced as part of the Prerelease information.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>Players may ask a judge for permission to replace a card with another version of the same card.</p> 
  <p>Because it was designed specifically for multiplayer play, the use of <em>Conspiracy</em> boosters in sanctioned, rated Limited-format tournaments (Sealed Deck and Booster Draft) is not permitted.</p> 
  <p>Six boosters per player are recommended for individual format Sealed Deck tournaments and 3 boosters per player for individual Booster or Team Rochester Draft tournaments. For the recommended product mix for the current block, refer to <a href="#mtr-appendix-d">Appendix D</a>.</p> 
  <p>If the Tournament Organizer allows players to provide their own product, that product must be pooled with the rest of the product for the tournament and randomly distributed.</p> 
  <p>If the Tournament Organizer is not providing extra land cards for use in a Limited tournament, they must announce this before tournament registration. Tournament Organizers may require players to return these land cards when they leave the tournament. Players may use their own basic lands during tournaments.</p>

  <h1 class="entry-title">MTR 7.7 Booster Draft Procedures</h1> 
 </header>
 <div class="entry-content"> 
  <p><span>All players must open and draft the same type of booster at the same time. Players open their first booster pack and count the cards face down, removing token cards, rules cards, and any other non-game cards. Players who receive an erroneous number of cards at any time must immediately notify a judge. After picking up the booster, players should remove and keep any non-foil Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, or Forest basic land cards and/or any other cards that are not legal to use in the draft, unless the basic land slot in a booster can also contain other draftable cards (such as non-basic lands and checklist cards in the land slot in the </span><i><span>Core 2019</span></i><span> expansion). Foil basic land cards should be left in the booster and drafted with the other cards. Players choose one card from their current booster pack and then pass the remaining cards face down to the player on their left until all cards are drafted. Once a player has removed a card from the pack and put it on top of their single, front face-down drafted pile, it is considered selected and may not be returned to the pack.</span></p>  
  <p>Players may not reveal the front face of their card selections or the contents of their current packs to other participants in the draft and must make a reasonable effort to keep that information from the sight of other players. Players are not permitted to reveal hidden information of any kind to other participants in the draft regarding their own picks or what they want others to pick. (Exception: This does not apply to double-faced cards, both faces of which may be revealed at any time during a draft.)</p>  
  <p>Players and teams may not look at their drafted cards between or during picks at Competitive and Professional Rules Enforcement Levels. At Regular Rules Enforcement Level, players are allowed to review their drafted cards between or during picks as long as they are holding no other cards at the same time. The Head Judge may choose to disallow this provided they announce it before the first draft. Between boosters there is a review period in which players may review their picks.</p> 
  <p>If the draft is not being timed, and two players do not wish to make a pick before the other player, the player closer to providing the other player with the pack picks first. If the players are equidistant, then the player in the lower seat number picks first.</p>  
  <p>After the first pack is drafted and the review period completed, players open the next pack and draft in the same fashion, except that the direction of drafting is reversed-it now proceeds to the right. This process is repeated, reversing the direction of drafting for each booster pack until all cards in all booster packs are drafted.</p> 
  <p>If a player is unable or unwilling to continue drafting, but wishes to remain in the tournament, they are suspended from drafting and must construct a deck from whatever cards they have drafted thus far. For the remainder of the draft, their picks are skipped and the draft continues with one fewer player.</p>

  <p>A valid team consists of two or three members, as appropriate to the format.

If a player drops from the tournament, the entire team is dropped from the tournament.&nbsp;<span>If a player is disqualified from the tournament, the entire team is disqualified from the tournament.</span></p> 
  <p>Teams must designate player positions during tournament registration. For example, in a three-player team tournament, each team must designate who is player A, player B, and player C. Players retain these designations throughout the entire tournament.</p> 
  <p>When two teams are paired against each other during the course of a tournament, the team members designated as "player A" play against each other, the team members designated as "player B" play against each other, and so on.</p>

(For example, if one player is using Naturalize in a Team Constructed tournament, no other player on that team may use Naturalize in their deck.) No players may use cards that are banned in a particular format. Cards that override deck construction rules (i.e. Relentless Rats, Shadowborn Apostle, etc) may only override them for one deck on a team.</span></p> 
  <p><span>Unified Deck Construction rules are only applied when all members of a team have decks of the same format.</span></p>

 <header class="entry-header" id="mtr8-5"> 
  <h1 class="entry-title">MTR 8.5 Team Rochester Draft Tournaments</h1> 
 </header>
 <div class="entry-content"> 
  <p>Team Rochester Draft tournaments require teams of three players each. Two teams are seated at each table for the draft. Team members sit clockwise in A-B-C order around the table. (For example, in a three-person team tournament, players sit around the table clockwise in this order: 1A, 1B, 1C, 2A, 2B, 2C.)</p> 
  <p>A team determined at random chooses either to pick first or to allow the other team to pick first. Player B of the team that picks first lays out the first pack.</p> 
  <p>The draft begins with the first player opening their first booster pack and laying out the entire contents of the pack face up on the table as directed by tournament officials, with the cards facing themselves. After reviewing the cards, drafting proceeds with each player selecting a single card in turn. Once a player has selected a card and placed it with their other drafted cards, they may not select a different card. If a player fails to select a card in the time given, a tournament official selects for that player the "oldest" card still remaining from the booster pack (the card on the table the longest).</p> 
  <p>The player drafting first from the cards presented on the table is called the active player. The first active player is the participant who opened the first booster of the draft, as designated by a tournament official. All players in each drafting pod serve as the active player once for each group of booster packs. The identity of the active player moves in a horseshoe pattern, clockwise for the first and third boosters and counter-clockwise for the second. The player who was last to open a booster pack from a group is the first to open the booster pack from the next group.</p> 
  <p>The draft order also begins moving in a horseshoe pattern, clockwise for the first and third boosters and counter-clockwise for the second, beginning with the active player, continuing around the table to the last player in the group to draft a card. The last player in the group selects two cards sequentially, and then drafting continues in reverse order, moving back to the player who began the drafting. If there are still cards remaining, the player who began the drafting selects two cards, and drafting continues again in the opposite direction.</p> 
  <p><em>Example:</em> Team 1 and Team 2 are seated around a table. They are numbered 1A-1B-1C-2A-2B-2C in a clockwise order. Team 2 wins the coin toss, and the members of Team 2 choose to let Team 1 pick first. The active player for the first pack is Player 1B. The first booster pack for Player 1B is opened and placed face up in front of Player 1B. After the 20-second review period has expired, the draft order is as follows:</p> 
  <table class="center"> 
   <tbody> 
    <tr> 
     <td>Player 1B-card 1</td>

 </header>
 <div class="entry-content"> 
  <p>All the rules for Limited Tournaments (Section 7) apply, except as described below.</p> 
  <p>Eight boosters per team are recommended for Two-Headed Giant Sealed Deck tournaments and six boosters per team for Two-Headed Giant Booster Draft tournaments. For the recommended product mix for the current block, refer to <a href="#mtr-appendix-d">Appendix D</a>.</p> 
  <p>Cards not used in a team's starting decks are considered a shared sideboard by the two players that both players can access.</p>

  <h1 class="entry-title">MTR 9.7 Two-Headed Giant Booster Draft Tournaments</h1> 
 </header>
 <div class="entry-content"> 
  <p>Teams (not players) assemble into random drafting circles (called pods) of roughly equal size at the direction of the Head Judge. Teammates sit next to each other. Tournament officials then distribute identical booster packs to each team in the pod.</p> 
  <p>After opening and counting the cards in their first pack, the team chooses two cards from the booster pack then passes the remaining cards face down to the team on its left. Selected cards may be placed into one or two piles. The cards chosen are not assigned to a particular player; they become part of a pool out of which both players will construct their decks. The open packs are passed around the drafting pod-with each team taking two cards from each before passing-until all cards are drafted.</p> 
  <p>For the second pack, the direction of drafting is reversed as usual. Thus, the overall draft direction is left-right-left-right-left-right.</p>

  <h1 class="entry-title">MTR 10.1 Participation Minimums</h1> 
 </header>
 <div class="entry-content"> 
  <p>Participation minimums for a tournament to be sanctioned as a rated tournament are as follows:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>For individual tournaments, a minimum of eight (8) players must participate.</li> 
   <li>For team and Two-Headed Giant tournaments, a minimum of four (4) teams must participate.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>If the participation minimum is not met, the tournament is no longer DCI-sanctioned and will not provide Planeswalker Points. If participation minimums are not met for any DCI-sanctioned tournament, the Tournament Organizer should report the tournament as "Did Not Occur."</p>

 <header class="entry-header" id="mtr10-2"> 
  <h1 class="entry-title">MTR 10.2 Number of Rounds</h1> 
 </header>
 <div class="entry-content"> 
  <p>The minimum number of rounds required for a tournament to be sanctioned as a rated tournament is as follows:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>For individual tournaments, a minimum of three (3) rounds</li> 
   <li>For team and Two-Headed Giant tournaments, a minimum of two (2) rounds</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>If the minimum number of rounds is not met, the tournament is no longer DCI-sanctioned and will not provide Planeswalker Points. If the minimum number of rounds is not met for any DCI-sanctioned, rated tournament, the Tournament Organizer should report the tournament as "Did Not Occur."</p> 
  <p>The number of rounds should be announced at or before the beginning of the first round; once announced, it cannot be changed. A variable number of rounds can be announced instead, with specific criteria for ending the tournament. For example, a tournament with 20 players can be announced as five rounds unless only one player has four match wins after four rounds.</p> 
  <p>The recommended number of rounds for Swiss tournaments can be found in <a href="#mtr-appendix-e">Appendix E</a>.</p>

  <h1 class="entry-title">MTR 10.3 Invitation-Only Tournaments</h1> 
 </header>
 <div class="entry-content"> 
  <p>Invitation-only tournaments have additional qualification criteria for player participation. The invitation list for Premier tournaments is defined in the <a href="http://wpn.wizards.com/en/document/magic-premier-event-invitation-policy"><strong>Magic: The Gathering</strong> Premier Event Invitation Policy</a>. Tournament Organizers may hold and sanction invitation-only non-Premier tournaments normally, as long as they offer a sufficient number of qualifying tournaments in advance to ensure that all players have a chance to qualify.</p>

 <header class="entry-header" id="mtr10-4"> 
  <h1 class="entry-title">MTR 10.4 Pairing Algorithm</h1> 
 </header>
 <div class="entry-content"> 
  <p>Unless otherwise announced, tournaments are assumed to follow the Swiss pairing algorithm. Some tournaments may proceed to single-elimination playoff rounds between the top 2, 4, or 8 (or other number) players after the Swiss rounds are over. The Swiss pairing algorithm is modified in Booster Draft tournaments as explained in <a href="#mtr7-6">section 7.6</a>.</p> 
  <p>For constructed tournaments that have a single-elimination playoff (or sealed deck tournaments that do not use a booster draft for the playoff), the recommended pairing method is to pair the playoff players by the final Swiss standings.</p> 
  <p>For an 8-player playoff, the 1st place player plays the 8th place player, the 2nd place player plays the 7th place player, the 3rd place player plays the 6th place player, and the 4th place player plays the 5th place player. The winners of the 1st/8th place and 4th/5th place matches play each other in the next round of the playoff. The winners of the 2nd/7th place and 3rd/6th place matches play each other in the next round of the playoff. The remaining players play in the last round of the playoff.</p>

 <div class="entry-content"> 
  <p><strong>Match Points</strong><br> Players earn 3 match points for each match win, 0 points for each match loss and 1 match point for each match ending in a draw. Players receiving byes are considered to have won the match.</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>A player's record is 6-2-0 (Wins-Losses-Draws). That player has 18 match points (6*3, 2*0, 0*1).</li> 
   <li>A player's record is 4-2-2. That player has 14 match points (4*3, 2*0, 2*1).</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p><strong>Game Points</strong><br> Game points are similar to match points in that players earn 3 game points for each game they win and 1 point for each game that ends in a draw, and 0 points for any game lost. Unfinished games are considered draws. Unplayed games are worth 0 points.</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>A player wins a match 2-0-0, so they earn 6 game points and their opponent receives 0 game points from the match.</li> 
   <li>A player wins a match 2-1-0, so they earn 6 game points and their opponent earns 3 game points from the match.</li> 
   <li>A player wins a match 2-0-1, so they earn 7 game points and their opponent earns 1 game point from the match.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p><strong>Match-win percentage</strong><br> A player's match-win percentage is that player's accumulated match points divided by the total match points possible in those rounds (generally, 3 times the number of rounds played). If this number is lower than 0.33, use 0.33 instead. The minimum match-win percentage of 0.33 limits the effect low performances have when calculating and comparing opponents' match-win percentage.</p> 
  <p><em>Examples:</em><br> These three players competed in an 8-round tournament, although only the first player completed all rounds.</p>

  <p><strong>Game-win percentage</strong><br> Similar to the match-win percentage, a player's game-win percentage is the total number of game points they earned divided by the total game points possible (generally, 3 times the number of games played).

  <p><strong>Opponents' match-win percentage</strong><br> A player's opponents' match-win percentage is the average match-win percentage of each opponent that player faced (ignoring those rounds for which the player received a bye). Use the match-win percentage definition listed above when calculating each individual opponent's match-win percentage.</p> 
  <p><em>Examples:</em></p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>A player's record in an eight-round tournament is 6-2-0. Their opponents' match records were: 4-4-0, 7-1-0, 1-3-1, 3-3-1, 6-2-0, 5-2-1, 4-3-1, and 6-1-1, so their opponents' match-win percentage is:<img class="aligncenter wp-image-416 size-full"

  <p><strong>Opponents' game-win percentages</strong><br> Similar to opponents' match-win percentage, a player's opponents' game-win percentage is simply the average game-win percentage of all of that player's opponents. And, as with opponents' match-win percentage, each opponent has a minimum game-win percentage of 0.33.</p> 
  <p><strong>Byes</strong><br> When a player is assigned a bye for a round, they are considered to have won the match 2-0.</p> 
  <p>Thus, that player earns 3 match points and 6 game points. A player's byes are ignored when computing their opponents' match-win and opponents' game-win percentages.</p>
